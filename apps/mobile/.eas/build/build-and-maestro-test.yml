build:
  name: Create a build and run Maestro tests on it
  steps:
    # Note: we could've run just eas/build instead of this ios-simulator-build block.
    # But for some reason eas/build runs prebuild on our project which tries to create ios/android folders.
    # It breaks the CI and we don't need to run it as our project is already prebuild.
    # So we take yaml that describes how it works underneath, copy all of the steps except eas/prebuild one
    # start ios-simulator-build
