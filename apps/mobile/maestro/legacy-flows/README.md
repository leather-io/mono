# Legacy maestro tests

The tests in this folder are legacy tests that are outdated and failing.

They need to be grouped together better and re-written but are left temporarily as a reference of the coverage we had before and of some useful patterns in maestro.

A lot of these tests used text assertion which makes them easy to read however soon became outdated with our CrowdIn setup.

They also relied heavily on `Developer tools` which was deprecated
