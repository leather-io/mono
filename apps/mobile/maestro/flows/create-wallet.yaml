# Leather Mobile Wallet Smoke Tests
appId: io.leather.mobilewallet
name: Create Wallet
---
# Scenario: User can create a new wallet
- launchApp

# Given the user is on the home screen
- assertVisible: 'All accounts'

- runScript: 'hello-world.js'
# When the user taps the create wallet card it should work
# - tapOn:
#     id: 'homeCreateWalletCard'
# - tapOn:
#     id: 'createNewWalletSheetButton'

# Hello World test works but can't get it to work with the clear-secure-store.js script
# can't see it logging anything in the console

# maybe its better to bring back a CI_ENV based button to clear the secure store? Then I can use it in the E2E tests locally too
