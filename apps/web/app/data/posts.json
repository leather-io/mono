Through the Leather browser extension, you can interact directly with user wallets using simple JavaScript methods. This integration supports Bitcoin-native actions and Stacks smart contract calls‚Äîall with secure user approval across desktop and mobile.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Detecting the Provider\n\nIn a browser environment, the Leather extension injects a global object into the window. You can detect and use it like this:\n\n[Unsupported block type: code]\n\nThis follows the `.request` method standard from the [Modern Wallet APIs proposal](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/pull/166).\n\n## Core Methods\n\n- `getAddresses`: Get Bitcoin (SegWit, Taproot) and Stacks addresses.\n- `signMessage`: Sign an arbitrary message with a Bitcoin address.\n- `sendTransfer`: Sign and broadcast a Bitcoin transaction.\n- `signPsbt`: Sign and broadcast a PSBT.\n- `Stacks Libraries`: Interact with Stacks smart contracts and assets.\n## TypeScript Support\n\nIf you're working in a TypeScript environment, Leather provides type definitions via the [`@leather.io/rpc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@leather.io/rpc) package. This package declares `LeatherProvider` on the global object and types its available methods and responses for better developer experience.\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install the typings package using your preferred package manager:\n\n[Unsupported block type: code]\n\nOnce installed, you'll benefit from autocomplete and type checking when interacting with the Leather API in your web app or extension.\n\n",

Unlike traditional Stacking, which requires commitment for multiple cycles, the Fast Pool offers more flexibility, allowing users to participate or withdraw with shorter time horizons.\n\nEach Stacking cycle lasts approximately two weeks, and FastPool.org provides transparent performance metrics by publishing the \"Rate per cycle\" for each completed round. Users can estimate the historical annual yield by averaging these per-cycle rates and extrapolating over the typical 26 cycles in a year. However, a more accurate approach uses the actual start and end dates for each cycle to calculate average cycle duration and then annualizes each `cycleYield` accordingly.\n\nUsing this improved method and the dataset from [Fast Pool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedger/stacks-stacking-stats/refs/heads/main/tools/data/all.json)['](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedger/stacks-stacking-stats/refs/heads/main/tools/data/all.json)[s GitHub repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedger/stacks-stacking-stats/refs/heads/main/tools/data/all.json), the average annualized yield is approximately **10.72%**.

    "Body": "# Revitalizing American Farmland with Agrivoltaics, Regenerative Practices, and Bitcoin Mining\n\n## Bitcoin Mining Meets Sustainable Farming\n\nIn honor of Earth Day, the April 22, 2025, episode of Leather Lounge explored a groundbreaking intersection of Bitcoin mining, renewable energy, and regenerative agriculture. Host Sean Longstreet welcomed Joshua Phelps and Mark Smith, co-founders of Carbon Country, to discuss their innovative approach to revitalizing American farmland.\n\n## Carbon Country: A Vision for Regenerative Agriculture\n\nCarbon Country is transforming small and medium-sized farms by combining agrivoltaics (solar energy and farming), carbon removal, and Bitcoin mining. ‚ÄúThese small farms‚Ä¶ are really going the way of the dodo bird,‚Äù Mark explains, highlighting the decline of family farms amid industrial monoculture. Their solution repurposes these properties to create sustainable value for communities and the environment.\n\nLocated on a 74-acre farm in Southern Maryland, Carbon Country‚Äôs pilot project integrates 5 megawatts of solar panels across 20 acres of pasture, designed with 15-foot gaps for tractor access. Sheep graze rotationally under the panels, benefiting from shade that reduces heat stress and water needs while improving weight gain. ‚ÄúThe sheep‚Ä¶ end up gaining weight faster because of the lack of heat stress,‚Äù Mark notes. This symbiotic relationship also benefits the solar operation, as sheep naturally manage grass without the need for mowers, reducing costs and environmental impact.\n\nAgrivoltaics offers additional environmental benefits, such as reducing water usage by providing shade that lowers evaporation rates, and fostering biodiversity by creating habitats for pollinators like bees and butterflies. Economically, it provides farmers with long-term stability through 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) adjusted for inflation, ensuring a reliable income stream alongside traditional farming revenue. Bitcoin mining further enhances this model by consuming excess solar energy, allowing farmers to net meter at higher rates and fund operations without relying on external financing.\n\n## Bitcoin Mining as a Catalyst for Renewable Energy\n\nCarbon Country uses Bitcoin mining to enhance the profitability of renewable energy assets, enabling farms to diversify income streams. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre using the Bitcoin mining‚Ä¶ to help allow the renewable energy assets‚Ä¶ be more profitable,‚Äù Mark explains. By consuming energy through mining, they can net meter up to 2 MW at retail rates (13 cents vs. 5 cents per kWh), as they‚Äôre able to sell twice the amount of energy they use. Additionally, through Maryland‚Äôs community solar program, they sell solar energy at retail rates with cost reductions for low-income residents (20%) and medium-income households (10%). It bolsters their overall financial model, allowing them to support the community more effectively.\n\nThe mined Bitcoin also serves as working capital, reducing farmers‚Äô reliance on bank loans. ‚ÄúIf you think about farming, the cash-flow issue is huge‚Äîyou borrow up front, pray the weather is right and the crops come in, and only after all that do you finally get paid,‚Äù Mark says. Bitcoin mining provides a steady income stream, helping farmers avoid debt and self-finance operations.\n\n## Regenerative Practices: Sheep, Soil, and Biochar\n\nCarbon Country‚Äôs regenerative practices enhance soil health and sequester carbon. Rotational grazing under solar panels mimics natural buffalo grazing, driving grass roots deeper and increasing soil organic carbon. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actually driving the roots of the grass deeper‚Ä¶ [to] leave the soil in better condition,‚Äù Mark shares. This prevents erosion, improves water retention, and supports long-term soil fertility, contrasting with the degradation caused by industrial farming.\n\nThe project also includes Maryland‚Äôs first large-scale biochar plant, which transforms wood chips into a carbon-rich soil amendment at 700¬∞C. Biochar sequesters carbon for centuries while improving soil productivity.\n\n## Community Impact: Energy Access and Economic Resilience\n\nCarbon Country prioritizes community benefits, selling solar energy to reduce local energy costs and creating jobs in farming, renewable energy, and carbon removal. ‚ÄúWe can really do a good turn for the community,‚Äù Mark says, noting the food insecurity in their area. However, they face resistance from traditional financial institutions due to Bitcoin mining‚Äôs stigma. ‚ÄúIt was more of a kind of choke point 2.0 situation, but like the minute that they heard we were Bitcoin miner was like, sorry, bye bye,‚Äù Mark reveals, referencing broader financial barriers like Operation Chokepoint 2.0 that limit crypto-related projects‚Äô access to banking services.\n\nDespite this, Carbon Country leverages Bitcoin to self-finance, avoiding traditional banking constraints. They‚Äôre also planning tiny homes for visitors, offering educational opportunities and additional revenue through platforms like Airbnb.\n\n## Educational Outreach: Inspiring the Next Generation\n\nBeyond their farm operations, Carbon Country is committed to educating the next generation about sustainable farming and renewable energy. ‚ÄúHow can we educate the next generation of farmers, electrical engineers, folks that‚Ä¶ want to get involved in the carbon removal space?‚Äù Mark asks, emphasizing their goal to inspire future innovators. They plan to host workshops and farm tours, inviting local schools and community groups to learn about agrivoltaics, biochar production, and Bitcoin mining‚Äôs role in clean energy. By sharing their knowledge, they hope to empower others to adopt similar practices, creating a ripple effect of sustainability across rural America. Readers can support this mission by visiting Carbon Country, participating in their programs, or following their journey to learn how Bitcoin can drive positive change.\n\n## Josh and Mark: A Synergistic Partnership\n\nJosh and Mark‚Äôs partnership began through mutual Web3 connections, bonding over a shared vision at Archive, a DAO bridging fine art and blockchain. Josh, with a background in NGOs and community building, left Mexico City to join Mark on the farm. ‚ÄúI was really enjoying my life‚Ä¶ in Mexico City‚Ä¶ [but] the answer was yes,‚Äù Josh recalls. Mark, a curious learner with a knack for mastering complex issues, drives the project‚Äôs technical and financial strategy.\n\nTogether, they‚Äôve built a lean operation, learning through hands-on experience and community support. ‚ÄúIt takes a village,‚Äù Mark says, crediting local collaborators like engineers and investors who provide expertise and resources. Their pioneering spirit‚Äîstringing fences, managing sheep, and setting up Bitcoin miners‚Äîembodies Bitcoin‚Äôs ethos of resilience and innovation. Looking ahead, Josh and Mark aim to scale their model by creating a blueprint for other farmers, encouraging them to integrate agrivoltaics and Bitcoin mining into their operations. ‚ÄúCome join the revolution,‚Äù Mark urges, inviting others to adopt their approach and build a network of sustainable farms, amplifying Bitcoin‚Äôs impact on rural economies.\n\n### Your Gateway to Bitcoin‚Äôs Sustainable Future with Leather\n\nCarbon Country‚Äôs farm-scale experiment shows that Bitcoin can underwrite clean energy, enrich soils, and steady rural incomes.

    "Body": "# \n\n# Pioneering Bitcoin DeFi with Hadan of ALEX Labs\n\n## ALEX Labs‚Äô Vision for Bitcoin DeFi\n\nIn the rapidly evolving Bitcoin ecosystem, ALEX Labs stands as a trailblazer, driving innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions that unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin holders. On the April 8, 2025, episode of Leather Lounge, host Sean Longstreet welcomed Hadan Espiridiao, ‚Äúpoet in residence‚Äù at the ALEX Lab Foundation, to discuss ALEX‚Äôs latest advancements and future plans. From the launch of ALEX DAMM‚Äîa discrete automated market maker for concentrated liquidity‚Äîto the integration of native USDT via Taproot assets, ALEX is redefining Bitcoin DeFi while staying true to its core values of security and accessibility. With over $2.6 billion in total value locked (TVL), ALEX has become a cornerstone of the ecosystem, and Leather, the premier Bitcoin wallet, empowers you to explore these advancements securely.\n\n## ALEX DAMM: Revolutionizing Liquidity for Bitcoin DeFi\n\nALEX Labs is set to roll out ALEX DAMM, a discrete automated market maker that introduces concentrated liquidity to Bitcoin DeFi. But what does this mean for you as a Leather user? Hadan explains, ‚ÄúA market maker connects buyers and sellers‚Ä¶ [and] an automated market maker [replaces] humans with code.‚Äù Traditional AMMs, like Uniswap‚Äôs V1, distribute liquidity across a wide price range‚Äîfrom zero to infinity‚Äîexposing liquidity providers (LPs) to risks like impermanent loss during extreme market swings.\n\nALEX DAMM allows LPs to focus their liquidity in narrow price bands‚Äî1%, 5%, 10%, or 20% around the current price. ‚ÄúBy concentrating your liquidity‚Ä¶ the potential yield you have may be significantly higher,‚Äù Hadan notes. For example, if Bitcoin stays within a 1% range, LPs can potentially earn triple-digit APRs due to high trading activity in that band. However, if the price moves outside this range, your liquidity converts entirely to one asset (e.g., all USDT if Bitcoin rises). To manage this risk, you can diversify across multiple buckets, such as placing some liquidity in the 5% or 10% ranges for a more balanced risk profile.\n\nFor traders using Leather, ALEX DAMM offers better prices, less slippage, and faster execution. ‚ÄúThat liquidity is so concentrated‚Ä¶ you as a trader are receiving better prices,‚Äù Hadan says. This creates a flywheel effect: more trading rewards LPs, attracting more liquidity, which benefits the entire ecosystem. ALEX DAMM also introduces advanced features like immediate-or-cancel and fill-or-kill orders, giving traders more control‚Äîsimilar to limit orders on centralized exchanges but without the centralization risks or KYC. With Leather‚Äôs secure self-custody wallet, you can confidently provide liquidity or trade on ALEX DAMM, knowing your Bitcoin remains private and protected.\n\n## Native USDT on Bitcoin: A New Era of Interoperability\n\nALEX Labs is preparing for the integration of native USDT via Taproot assets, a development Hadan describes as transformative. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to understate the significance‚Ä¶ [as] a Bitcoin holder, [you can] hold both Bitcoin and the largest stablecoin by market cap natively in your Bitcoin wallet,‚Äù he explains. This integration, expected to leverage the Lightning Network, will enable permissionless US dollar transfers globally within seconds, secured by Bitcoin‚Äôs hash power.\n\nFor Leather users, this means seamless swaps between Bitcoin and USDT directly from your wallet. ALEX‚Äôs X-Link bridge will allow you to move assets between Bitcoin‚Äôs L1 and L2s like Stacks. ‚ÄúYou can connect your Bitcoin wallet‚Ä¶ and with one click‚Ä¶ do a swap from Bitcoin to USDT,‚Äù Hadan says. ALEX is even developing cross-chain hooks to compress these swaps into a single Bitcoin transaction, ensuring your USDT converts to Bitcoin within one block. This streamlined process makes DeFi more accessible, especially for Bitcoin maximalists who prefer a native Bitcoin experience.\n\nStacks plays a crucial role as a ‚Äúuniversal smart contract layer‚Äù that reads and writes to Bitcoin‚Äôs L1 while remaining 100% secured by its hash power. With Leather, you can access these features without needing a separate Stacks wallet‚Äîeverything is abstracted, allowing you to focus on exploring DeFi while Leather keeps your assets secure.\n\n## ALEX AI: Simplifying DeFi with Artificial Intelligence\n\nALEX Labs is set to launch ALEX AI in 2025, an AI-powered tool designed to make Bitcoin DeFi accessible to everyone. ‚ÄúAnyone in our space that‚Äôs helped onboard a new user knows‚Ä¶ so much of it is answering dozens of questions,‚Äù Hadan notes. ALEX AI will provide 24/7 support, answering queries like ‚ÄúWhat is slippage?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow can I earn yield on my Bitcoin?‚Äù while enabling users to execute transactions via text or voice commands in any language.\n\nImagine using Leather to connect to ALEX and asking, ‚ÄúSwap $1,000 of USDT to Bitcoin.‚Äù ALEX AI will guide you through setting slippage levels, confirm the transaction, and execute it‚Äîall without navigating complex interfaces. Or you might say, ‚ÄúI have Bitcoin in my wallet‚Äîhow can I earn yield?‚Äù ALEX AI could respond with options like staking in Surge pools or providing liquidity on ALEX DAMM, then execute your choice with a simple voice command. ‚ÄúNo matter where you are in the world, in your native tongue‚Ä¶ you can execute and engage with smart contracts,‚Äù Hadan envisions.\n\n## Surge Campaign: Gamifying DeFi Participation\n\nALEX Labs‚Äô Surge campaign gamifies yield farming and governance, making DeFi engaging for the community. The third Surge round recently concluded, offering yields like 46% for ALEX-sBTC pairs, 8% for stable pairs like aBTC-sBTC, and up to 240% for meme coin pools. Surge 4, set to launch alongside the sBTC cap 3 release by late April 2025, promises even more opportunities.\n\n‚ÄúSurge allocated about 12 million ALEX‚Ä¶ for community LP pools,‚Äù Hadan shares. Users vote on their favorite pools, and rankings determine reward distribution. You can even donate voter rewards to incentivize votes, adding a fun, community-driven element. Between Surge rounds, Hadan advises staking in ALEX‚Äôs farming pools for 30‚Äì40% APRs over 3‚Äì4 cycles (about 12‚Äì16 days), ensuring you‚Äôre ready for Surge 4. For example, you might stake your sBTC in an ALEX pool now, earn yield, and withdraw in time to join Surge 4‚Äôs high-yield opportunities.\n\nWith Leather, you can securely stake your assets and participate in Surge, exploring Bitcoin DeFi with confidence. Leather‚Äôs self-custody design ensures your Bitcoin remains private, letting you focus on maximizing your yield without worrying about security.\n\n## Permissionless Self-Service Listings: Empowering Communities\n\nALEX Labs recently introduced permissionless self-service token listings, building on contributions from Stacks developer Marvin Jensen. ‚ÄúDeFi protocols on Stacks can interact with any token securely‚Ä¶ [proving] that code base matches an existing code base,‚Äù Hadan explains. This allows communities to list tokens on ALEX‚Äôs DEX without bottlenecks, as code verification ensures security without human review.\n\nFor Leather users, this opens up a world of community tokens‚Äîfrom meme coins to utility tokens‚Äîall tradable on ALEX. Imagine discovering a new Stacks-based meme coin listed on ALEX, connecting your Leather wallet, and trading it with a few clicks. This aligns with Bitcoin‚Äôs permissionless ethos, enabling you to explore new projects while Leather keeps your assets safe.\n\n## Resilience in Crisis: ALEX‚Äôs Response to the Lazarus Group Hack\n\nALEX Labs‚Äô commitment to user trust was tested in May 2024, when the Lazarus Group‚Äîa North Korean hacker collective‚Äîtargeted the protocol. ‚ÄúWe immediately went into fight mode,‚Äù Hadan recalls. The team built custom tracking tools, froze funds across dozens of centralized exchanges, and pursued legal action, recovering nearly 1 million STX by March 2025. Through the ALEX Treasury Grant program, 100% of protocol revenue funds user recovery, with all transactions transparently recorded on-chain.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here for the long haul,‚Äù Hadan emphasizes, noting that no team member resigned post-hack‚Äîa testament to their resilience. Hadan remains optimistic, believing that as Stacks and ALEX grow (potentially 10x or 100x), protocol revenues will accelerate user recovery. With Leather, you can engage with ALEX knowing they prioritize security and transparency, ensuring your Bitcoin remains protected as you explore their platform.\n\n## Hadan‚Äôs Journey: From Physics to Poetry in DeFi\n\nHadan‚Äôs unique perspective as ALEX‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeFi Poet‚Äù adds a humanistic touch to Bitcoin DeFi. A former physics major at Harvard, Hadan transitioned to finance at Goldman Sachs before joining ALEX Labs in 2021. His passion for poetry, inspired by classics like T.S. Eliot and Tennyson, shapes his mission to make DeFi accessible. ‚ÄúI felt like‚Ä¶ I could contribute by trying to help humanize crypto,‚Äù he shares, drawing on poetry to convey Bitcoin‚Äôs deeper meaning as a tool for financial freedom.\n\nReflecting on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential, Hadan quotes Tennyson‚Äôs *Ulysses*: ‚ÄúWe are‚Ä¶ strong in will to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.‚Äù For Hadan, Bitcoin is a call to action‚Äîa way to move from apathy to engagement, empowering users to opt into a decentralized future. ‚ÄúBy owning Bitcoin, you are actively voting‚Ä¶ [for] a radically different system,‚Äù he says, emphasizing its role in democratizing finance. With Leather, you can take that step, securely connecting to ALEX and joining this financial frontier.\n\n## Your Gateway to Bitcoin DeFi with Leather\n\nALEX Labs‚Äô innovations‚Äîfrom ALEX DAMM‚Äôs concentrated liquidity to native USDT integration‚Äîopen new frontiers in Bitcoin DeFi, empowering you to do more with your Bitcoin.

We believe in a decentralized ecosystem that puts users first, driving us to prioritize transparency and user empowerment in everything we do.\n\n# Leather: A Self-Custodial Wallet\n\nMost crypto users are familiar with an important phrase and principle: ‚ÄúNot Your Keys, Not Your Coins.‚Äù It implies that ownership and control of one‚Äôs private keys are essential for managing and safeguarding their assets.\n\nAs a self-custodial wallet, Leather ensures that users retain complete control over their private keys and, as a result, their own digital assets. By entrusting private keys solely to the user, Leather mitigates the vulnerabilities inherent in custodial services that can lead to potential security breaches. Security begins and ends with ownership, which is why our users‚Äô Secret Keys and passwords are known only to them.\n\nIt is important to note that given our emphasis on providing users with a self-custodial wallet, Leather does not store Secret Keys. Users are responsible for securing their own Secret Keys and can refer to [this guide](https://leather.io/guides/secure-secret-key) for suggestions on how to do so.\n\n# In-App Security Features for Users\n\nGiven that Leather is a self-custodial wallet, we also give users a number of features that help them secure their own Leather accounts. This includes but is not limited to:\n\n- **Locking and unlocking their wallets:** Users can effortlessly [lock and unlock](https://leather.io/guides/lock-and-unlock-wallet) their wallets, granting them control over when their funds can be accessed on a specific device.\n- **Asset migration:** Leather facilitates secure asset migration, allowing users to seamlessly [transfer their funds from one wallet to another](https://leather.io/guides/migrate-assets-wallets) should they need to do so.\n- **Multiple account creation:** Users can [create multiple accounts](https://leather.io/guides/add-or-restore-accounts) associated with a single wallet. This allows them to compartmentalize their funds for organizational purposes, or utilize burner wallets for temporary and test transactions.\n- **Exclusive access to their Secret Key:** Leather users can [view their Secret Key in-app](https://leather.io/guides/view-secret-key) via a tab that is only accessible to them.\nThese are some of the features that Leather offers users, empowering them to safeguard their own assets.\n\n# Audited By Security Professionals\n\nLeather has been audited by Least Authority, a leading security consultancy that specializes in conducting security audits for crypto companies, and is part of the Hacker One bug bounty program. These partnerships are a testament to Leather‚Äôs proactive approach in preempting security risks that could compromise users‚Äô assets.\n\nLeast Authority‚Äôs full audit of Leather (formerly Hiro Wallet) from 2021 is still publicly available and can be [viewed via the wallet‚Äôs Github repo](https://github.com/leather-wallet/extension/blob/main/public/docs/least-authority-security-audit-report.pdf). The audit was conducted as Leather, which was initially a desktop wallet application primarily dedicated to STX holdings, was looking to publish the first version of its browser extension in the Chrome and Firefox stores.\n\nLeather‚Äôs collaboration with Least Authority and HackerOne underscores its unwavering commitment to security and user protection.\n\n# Timeline of Addressed Wallet Vulnerabilities\n\nOur ongoing commitment to transparency and security means that it‚Äôs important for our team to work around the clock to identify and address any possible vulnerabilities that may exist with Leather.\n\nSome of the security vulnerabilities we‚Äôve addressed in the past include:\n\n### August 2023: Cached Secret Key\n\n**Reported:** August 8, 2023\n\n**Resolved:** August 10, 2023\n\nWe received a report highlighting a potential vulnerability related to the ‚Äúimport wallet through Secret Key‚Äù feature. The use of the ‚Äútextarea‚Äù tag to store private keys/mnemonics meant that it was possible for browsers to cache users‚Äô private keys in local storage, leaving them vulnerable if another party obtained unauthorized access to their computer. To mitigate this risk, [a fix was promptly implemented](https://github.com/hirosystems/wallet/commit/108fdf865e00b545f29f8fca15e7a7869a8da097) with version 6.3.1 of the wallet extension, ensuring that users‚Äô private keys remain secure.\n\n### July 2022: appPrivateKey Vulnerability\n\n**Reported:** July 7, 2022\n\n**Resolved:** July 7, 2022\n\nIn July 2022, a vulnerability affecting the wallet‚Äôs authentication feature was reported. This vulnerability, which was found in versions prior to v3.11.2, could potentially allow attackers to obtain the appPrivateKey of any domain if a malicious authentication request were approved. While there were no known cases where an attacker exploited this vulnerability, the potential risk to user data was significant enough for the team to [deploy a patch](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-wallet-web/pull/2545) that validated the redirect_uri value. This ensured that only the requesting origin‚Äôs domain is passed to the @stacks/wallet-sdk library.\n\n### December 2022: Browser Locking Issues\n\n**Reported:** December 4, 2022\n\n**Resolved:** December 5, 2022 for Chrome; January 25, 2023 for Firefox\n\nA vulnerability identified in December 2022 highlighted a potential risk where a user‚Äôs wallet account could remain unlocked and accessible if multiple tabs or windows with the browser extension were open. Although users‚Äô Secret Keys were not compromised in any novel way, an unauthorized party could access a user‚Äôs wallet extension if they gained physical access to their computer. To mitigate this risk, [a fix was implemented](https://github.com/hirosystems/wallet/pull/2917) that allowed the extension to be locked in all tabs and windows if a user opted to lock their wallet in just one open browser tab.\n\n### April 2021: Plain text passwords stored in memory\n\n**Reported:** April 9, 2021\n\n**Resolved:** May 5, 2021\n\nThis vulnerability would appear when the desktop wallet was launched and a user checked their tacks address. The user‚Äôs wallet password and address would both be seen in the memory as part of a memory dump.\n\nThese security vulnerabilities were identified and promptly addressed, underscoring our commitment to prioritizing the safety and security of our users‚Äô assets. As Leather is an open-source wallet, a number of community contributors also played their part in helping us identify and resolve these existing issues.\n\n# Keeping Your Assets Safe with Leather\n\nLeather‚Äôs commitment to user security is one of the cornerstones of our mission to build the most reliable and secure Bitcoin wallet. We want to give users full control over their digital assets and play our part in ensuring that they have access to a wallet free of security vulnerabilities.\n\nOur dedication to transparency and accountability is evident through past audits and our swift approach to addressing possible issues in-app. By quickly resolving security concerns and implementing user-friendly safeguards, we‚Äôre protecting our users while also empowering them to secure their own wallets.\n\nThis is especially important as more use cases and decentralized applications are built on Bitcoin. The Bitcoin ecosystem is rapidly changing, and it‚Äôs up to our team to continue innovating and evolving with it.\n\n",

We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us below.\n\n# Transfer of Personal Information Overseas\n\nWe are a global company and will collect and process your Personal Information around the globe. Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction from where it was collected and the applicable data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.\n\n# Disclosure of Personal Information\n\nPersonal Information may be shared in the following circumstances:\n\n### Service Providers or Processors\n\nWe may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers or contractors (processors) who use this information to perform services for us, such as hosting providers, auditors, advisors, consultants, customer service and/or support providers and other similar service providers.\n\n### Analytics Tools\n\nWe may share Personal Information with third parties that provide campaign measurement, online and/or mobile analytics, and related services.

The privacy laws in countries outside the UK and EEA may be different from those in your home country.\n\nWhere we transfer data to a country that has not been deemed to provide adequate data protection standards, we will always have security measures and approved European or UK model clauses (available on the European Union‚Äôs legal website at eur-lex.europa.eu and the UK ones at the ICO website www.ico.gov.uk) or other adequate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Information. Please contact us if you would like more details about our safeguards for data transfers outside of the UK/EEA.\n\n### For other users\n\nIf we transfer your Personal Information to countries outside of your home country, we will take steps to comply with the requirements for such transfer in your home country as required by relevant law.\n\n# Cookies and Analytics\n\nWe use cookies, pixels, tags, and other technologies, which may be provided by third parties, on our Services to enable certain functionality and for security and fraud detection and prevention, as well as to collect usage information about our Website and the emails that we send and to personalize content and provide more relevant ads and information. We may combine the information we collect via these technologies with other information, including Personal Information.\n\n### Cookies\n\nCookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies enable you to log-in to our Services or save certain settings and preferences, while others allow us to track usage and activities on our Services, personalize content, or deliver more relevant ads. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The \"Help\" tab on the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you block cookies, however, certain features on our Website may not be available or function properly.\n\nThird parties may use cookies and other similar technologies to collect or receive information from our Site and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide you with targeted ads. If you would like to opt-out of such advertising practices on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please go to http://optout.aboutads.info/. The Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt-out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org to learn more. Note that opting-out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted-out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and usage patterns.\n\n### Pixel tags and embedded script¬†(aka clear GIFs and web beacons).\n\nPixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer‚Äôs hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use these, in connection with our Website to, among other things, track the activities of the users of our Services, improve ads, personalize and manage content, and gather usage information about our Website. We may also use these in HTML emails to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.\n\n### Third-Party Analytics Tools.\n\nOur Website uses automated devices and applications operated by third parties, such as Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Website and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google's practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and you can opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\n\n# Security of Data\n\nThe security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We also have procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach, and we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.\n\n# Links to Other Sites and Platforms\n\nOur Service may contain links to other websites, plug-ins and applications that are not operated by us. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site, which may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. This Policy does not apply to third-party websites that are accessible through the Services, unless such website directs users or visitors to this Policy. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of the Services and connected to the website of the organization or company that maintains that website.\n\nWe have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit.\n\n# Children's Privacy\n\nOur services are not offered to children and we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18 (or majority in the jurisdiction they are accessing the services from). Should we discover that we have collected Personal Information online from a child who is under the legal age, we will promptly delete that Personal Information. If you have concerns over the collection of children's Personal Information on the Services, please contact us at the information provided in the Contact Us section below.¬† Although our Services are not directed to children, if your child uses our Services and you wish to review or delete your child‚Äôs Personal Information, you may so request by contacting us at the location or email address set forth below under ‚ÄòContact Us.‚Äô\n\n### Do Not Track\n\nWe do not currently recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù (DNT) signals sent by web browsers, mobile devices, or other mechanisms. Third parties may be able to collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services when you use the Services. You also may limit certain tracking by disabling cookies in your web browser.\n\n### Your Data Access Rights\n\nDepending on where you live, you may have certain rights, such as to request access to or correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. To make a request, please email: legal@leather.io.¬† Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country, and many countries provide a right to lodge a complaint with the regulator. The rights that may be available to you include rights such as:\n\n### European Union and United Kingdom:\n\nWhere EU and UK regulations apply, you have the right to:\n\nBe informed through clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your Personal Information and your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this Policy. If you have any additional questions, for example regarding transfers and locations of data or our legitimate interests basis, please contact us.\n\nRequest access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\") if we are processing it, and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Policy). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it in accordance with data protection law.\n\nRequest correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\nRequest erasure of your Personal Information (also known as the ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no compelling reason for us keep using it, when you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons that will be notified to you and because of our use of blockchain technology.\n\nObject to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes or where we are relying on our legitimate interests for processing. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:\n\n- If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.\n- Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.\n- Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\n- You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\nWhen processing is restricted, we can still store your Personal Information, but we may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be restriction to make sure the restriction is respected in future.\n\nRequest the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\nLodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your Personal Information with your national data protection regulator. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner, and details of how to contact the ICO can be found on their website at ico.org.uk.\n\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information, including using your Personal Information for marketing purposes. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n\nNo fee usually required. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\n\nWhat we may need from you. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\n\nTime limit to respond. We try to respond to all requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\nPlease consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we will come back to you and let you know.\n\n### United States Residents:\n\n**California Shine the Light.** Where applicable, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 allows California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request please contact us using the information provided in the Contact Us section below.\n\n**Nevada Residents.** If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Information to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Information. You can exercise this right by contacting us at legal@leather.io¬† with the subject line ‚ÄúNevada Do Not Sell Request‚Äù and providing us with your name and the email address associated with your account.¬† Please note that we do not currently sell your Personal Information as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A. If you have any questions, please contact us as set forth below.\n\n# Changes to This Privacy Policy\n\nWe may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.\n\nWe will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to any significant changes becoming effective and update the \"effective date\" at the top of this Privacy Policy.\n\nYou are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.\n\nContacting us\n\nIf you have any questions about this Policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us using the details set out below.\n\n**Email address:** legal@leather.io\n\n**Postal address:**\n\nLeather c/o Nassau Machines Inc.\n\n228 Park Avenue South, #63011\n\nNew York, NY 10003\n\nYou have the right to make a complaint at any time to your local data protection supervisory authority. We would, however, appreciate the chance to respond to your concerns before you approach them so do contact us in the first instance.\n\n",

    "Title": "Stacking minimum commitment",
    "Slug": "stacking-minimum-commitment",
    "Body": "**Stacking minimum commitment** refers to the minimum amount of STX tokens a user must commit to participate in earning rewards through the Stacking mechanism on the Stacks blockchain. This threshold plays a critical role in determining who is eligible to contribute to the network‚Äôs Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus and earn Bitcoin or other rewards in return.\n\nAt the protocol level, Stacking requires participants to control enough STX to qualify for at least one reward slot. This threshold is dynamic and depends on total network participation in a given cycle. As of recent cycles, the protocol minimum has floated around **100,000 STX**. Meeting this on your own is often impractical for individual users, which is why pooled Stacking has become the default method for most.\n\n**Pooled Stacking** removes this high barrier by allowing users to combine their STX with others through a Stacking pool. The pool itself meets the protocol minimum, while each individual user contributes only a portion of that amount. This makes it possible to Stack with much smaller holdings‚Äîcommonly as low as **50 to 500 STX**, depending on the pool‚Äôs rules.\n\nEach pool defines its own **minimum STX requirement** based on factors like operating costs, network efficiency, and reward slot availability. Some pools may accept any amount over a low threshold (e.g. 10 STX), while others set higher minimums to maintain performance. These minimums are enforced at the pool level‚Äînot by the protocol‚Äîand can vary over time.\n\nIn Leather, these pool-specific minimums are presented clearly before you commit. Whether you‚Äôre using a native pool integration or connecting with an external protocol, you‚Äôll always see the current minimum STX amount required to participate. If your balance is below that threshold, you won‚Äôt be able to join the pool until you increase your STX holdings.\n\n**Liquid Stacking** introduces more flexibility. In these protocols, your STX is deposited into a smart contract that manages the actual Stacking process. You receive a synthetic token in return (like stSTX or stkSTX), which represents your stacked position and continues earning rewards. Most liquid Stacking protocols **have no strict minimum**, or set very low minimums‚Äîsometimes under 1 STX‚Äîto maximize accessibility.\n\nHowever, even in liquid Stacking, the protocol behind the scenes must still aggregate enough STX across all users to meet PoX requirements. If the system doesn't collectively reach the needed threshold, rewards may not be earned for that cycle. This makes it important to track protocol-level performance as well as individual access.\n\nBy surfacing real-time minimums and partner integrations, Leather helps users of all sizes Stack efficiently. Whether you're holding 100 STX or 10,000, you can see which pools or liquid protocols accept your amount and start earning Bitcoin or other token rewards with just a few clicks.\n\nUnderstanding the minimum STX amount required is key to accessing the yield opportunities available in the Stacks ecosystem. Leather ensures that this information is always transparent, up-to-date, and easy to act on‚Äîso you can participate with confidence, regardless of how much STX you hold.\n\n",

    "Title": "Troy Cross on Bitcoin‚Äôs Energy Impact and Societal Transformation",
    "Slug": "troy-cross-bitcoin-energy-societal-transformation",
    "Body": "In a recent episode of *The Leather Lounge*, Troy Cross, a philosopher and Bitcoin advocate, joined host Sean Longstreet to explore Bitcoin‚Äôs unique relationship with energy, its societal implications, and the philosophical shifts it demands. Troy‚Äôs insights reframed the common debates around Bitcoin‚Äôs environmental footprint, offering a nuanced perspective that positions Bitcoin as a driver of both energy efficiency and societal change.\n\n## Bitcoin Mining: A Unique Species in the Energy Landscape\n\nTroy likens Bitcoin mining to a scavenger species in the energy ecosystem ‚Äî much like a dung beetle ‚Äî thriving on stranded, wasted, or unwanted energy. This analogy challenges the traditional criticism of Bitcoin's energy consumption, reframing it as a mechanism for efficiency and innovation.\n\n## Turning Waste Into Opportunity\n\n**Stranded Methane Mitigation**\n\nBitcoin mining captures methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and converts it into less harmful CO‚ÇÇ. This not only mitigates environmental harm but also creates economic value from otherwise wasted resources.\n\n**Renewable Energy Overproduction**\n\nSolar and wind farms often produce excess energy that the grid can't handle, leading to inefficiencies. Bitcoin mining offers a solution by absorbing this surplus energy, stabilizing grids, and encouraging further investment in renewable infrastructure.\n\nTroy challenges the typical question, *‚ÄúHow much energy does Bitcoin use?‚Äù* Instead, he encourages a shift in perspective: *‚ÄúWhat kind of energy does Bitcoin use, and why?‚Äù* This reframing highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a tool for environmental progress rather than a threat to sustainability.\n\n## From Skeptic to Advocate: Troy‚Äôs Personal Journey\n\nTroy‚Äôs relationship with Bitcoin has been one of transformation. In 2011, he began mining Bitcoin but stopped over concerns about its environmental impact. Over time, advocates like Lyn Alden and Nic Carter, along with his own research, reshaped his understanding.\n\nToday, Troy sees Bitcoin as a catalyst for sustainability rather than a threat ‚Äî demonstrating how open dialogue and new evidence can challenge even deeply held assumptions.\n\n## Living a Double Life: Philosophy Meets Bitcoin\n\nAs a philosopher, Troy navigates the structured, hierarchical world of academia while simultaneously engaging with Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized ethos. He describes this as living a ‚Äúdouble life‚Äù ‚Äî a reflection of Bitcoin‚Äôs disruptive nature and its challenge to traditional systems of power and knowledge.\n\nBitcoin forces individuals and institutions to adapt to a new paradigm ‚Äî one that questions established frameworks and shifts the balance of economic and political power. For Troy, this duality mirrors the broader societal transformation that Bitcoin is driving.\n\n## The Adoption Framework: How Bitcoin Gains Momentum\n\nTroy outlined a framework for how Bitcoin adoption progresses through societal groups:\n\n1. **Wall Street and Financial Players**\n1. **Media and Journalists**\n1. **The Broader Middle Class**\n1. **Academia and Intellectuals**\nThis framework highlights the importance of building trust and visibility across all societal groups to drive long-term adoption.\n\n## Bitcoin‚Äôs Broader Implications: A Radical Invention\n\nBitcoin represents more than financial innovation ‚Äî it‚Äôs a new framework for societal organization and wealth transfer.\n\n**Generational Wealth Transfer**\n\nBitcoin empowers younger generations to build wealth outside of traditional systems, challenging entrenched economic inequality and promoting financial independence.\n\n**Decentralized Mining and Heating**\n\nTroy envisions a future where Bitcoin mining integrates with energy infrastructure ‚Äî mining rigs could serve as localized heating solutions, reducing reliance on vulnerable grid systems and improving energy efficiency.\n\n**A Framework for Curiosity and Innovation**\n\nAs an educator, Troy emphasizes the need to cultivate curiosity, resilience, and communication ‚Äî qualities exemplified by early Bitcoiners. Bitcoin fosters values like independence, collaboration, and innovation, which are critical for addressing societal challenges.\n\n## The Privilege of Being Early\n\nTroy Cross views Bitcoin as a radical invention reshaping the world in profound ways. Being early to Bitcoin, he suggests, is both a privilege and a challenge ‚Äî requiring patience, vision, and a willingness to adapt.\n\nHe invites us to rethink the narratives around Bitcoin‚Äôs energy use, societal impact, and environmental potential. Bitcoin, Troy argues, is not just a financial tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a transformative framework for reimagining societal and economic structures.\n\nTo explore more, follow Troy Cross on X (@thetrocro) and listen to the full conversation on *Leather Lounge* Episode #34.\n\n",

    "Body": "Historical yield (APY or APR) refers to the actual returns users have earned over time by participating in yield-generating protocols, typically expressed as an **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)** or **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**. In the context of the Stacks ecosystem and Leather, this includes BTC earned through traditional Stacking, **sBTC or STX earned via DeFi protocols**, and other emerging assets integrated into Bitcoin-secured applications.\n\nAPY accounts for compounding over the year‚Äîi.e., reinvesting earnings to generate additional returns‚Äîwhile APR reflects a flat annualized rate without compounding. While both serve as benchmarks, APY tends to give a more holistic picture when rewards are reinvested or auto-compounded, as seen in some liquid Stacking or DeFi vaults.\n\nHistorical yield is important because it gives users **transparency into real-world performance**‚Äînot just advertised or theoretical returns. By viewing what rewards have actually been distributed over time, users can better compare different providers, pools, or protocols, and calibrate their expectations more accurately.\n\nIn **pooled Stacking**, historical yield typically refers to BTC received over prior reward cycles. These yields can vary depending on how often the pool was eligible for reward slots, the amount of STX delegated to it, and fluctuations in network-wide participation. Leather presents this data directly in-app, showing users past BTC payouts over a range of timeframes.\n\nIn **liquid Stacking**, users receive yield-bearing tokens like **stSTX or stkSTX**, which may pass on rewards in BTC, STX, or even **synthetic assets like sBTC**. Historical yield here can reflect more variability depending on the smart contracts involved and whether the protocol reinvests rewards or distributes them directly. Leather supports display of these historical metrics where partners provide them, helping users evaluate DeFi-integrated yield sources with greater clarity.\n\nBeyond Stacking, other yield sources are emerging in the Stacks ecosystem‚Äîsuch as sBTC lending, STX liquidity mining, or DeFi vault strategies. Each may offer historical APY or APR data in their interfaces. Leather helps aggregate and surface this data wherever possible, giving users a **unified view of past performance** across protocols.\n\nEvaluating historical yield is especially helpful for comparing different strategies. For example, one pool might consistently offer BTC yield via traditional Stacking, while another DeFi strategy may offer higher APY in STX but carry more risk. Historical returns don‚Äôt guarantee future performance, but they help users decide where to allocate capital based on proven outcomes.\n\nImportantly, all historical yield displayed in Leather reflects **non-custodial participation**‚Äîyou stay in control of your funds, while the wallet surfaces data from verified partners and protocols. Whether you‚Äôre comparing BTC rewards from Stacking or STX rewards from a DeFi pool, you‚Äôre viewing **real, protocol-level performance metrics**, not projections.\n\nUltimately, historical yield is a cornerstone metric for evaluating Bitcoin-based and Bitcoin-adjacent returns in the Stacks ecosystem. With Leather, users can access this data directly in the wallet, compare across providers, and confidently choose yield strategies that align with their risk profile and financial goals.\n\n",

    "Title": "Stacking",
    "Slug": "stacking",
    "Body": "Stacking is a core feature of the Stacks blockchain that allows STX holders to **earn Bitcoin (BTC) rewards** by supporting the network‚Äôs operation. It‚Äôs an innovation made possible through Stacks‚Äô unique **Proof of Transfer (PoX)** consensus mechanism, which anchors the Stacks blockchain to Bitcoin. In return for temporarily locking your STX, you receive BTC that is transferred to you by miners who compete to add new blocks to the chain.\n\nWhat makes Stacking different from traditional staking systems in other blockchains is that the rewards come in **Bitcoin**, not STX or an inflationary token. This makes Stacking one of the only ways in the crypto ecosystem where you can earn BTC yield by putting another token (STX) to work. The Bitcoin you earn comes from Stacks miners, who spend BTC to participate in PoX consensus and secure the network.\n\nIn practice, there are two accessible ways to Stack your STX with Leather: **pooled Stacking** and **liquid Stacking**. Both methods allow you to participate without needing a large balance of STX or any advanced technical setup. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how each of these options work.\n\n**Pooled Stacking** is the most straightforward entry point for most users. Instead of meeting the full network minimum for Stacking on your own, you combine your STX with others in a pool. The pool operator handles the technical details‚Äîlike running infrastructure and managing reward distribution‚Äîwhile you simply choose the amount of STX to commit and for how many reward cycles. Your STX is temporarily locked (you can‚Äôt transfer it while it‚Äôs stacked), but remains in your control throughout the process. When the cycle ends, your STX unlocks automatically, and your share of BTC rewards is sent to your wallet.\n\nPools offer important flexibility. You can choose between custodial and non-custodial pools, fixed or flexible locking periods, and different reward strategies. Leather integrates with top pool providers, so you can browse, compare, and participate in just a few clicks‚Äîwithout leaving the wallet.\n\n**Liquid Stacking**, on the other hand, is designed for users who want to stay active with their assets. When you use a liquid Stacking protocol, your STX is still locked for the purpose of PoX, but you receive a liquid token in return‚Äîtypically something like **stSTX** or **stkSTX**. This token represents your stacked position and accrues BTC yield, but it also remains transferable and usable across DeFi apps on Stacks.\n\nWith a liquid token in hand, you can do things like trade, lend, or use it as collateral, all while continuing to earn your share of Bitcoin rewards. Liquid Stacking is made possible by decentralized protocols built on top of Stacks, and it introduces new possibilities for yield strategies without losing out on core PoX rewards. Leather makes this available by integrating directly with liquid Stacking partners, letting you access this feature securely from your wallet.\n\nThere are trade-offs between the two methods. Pooled Stacking is simple and predictable‚Äîyou lock your STX and receive BTC rewards directly, with no need to manage or track a synthetic token. Liquid Stacking offers more flexibility, but introduces smart contract risk and variability in token value depending on market conditions. The right approach depends on your personal strategy and how you want to interact with your assets.\n\nRegardless of which method you choose, Stacking through Leather is a non-custodial process. Your private keys and funds remain in your control, and Leather acts as the secure interface that connects you with the protocols and pools that make Stacking possible. Whether you're seeking simple Bitcoin rewards or more advanced DeFi strategies, Leather gives you the tools to Stack confidently and securely.\n\n",

    "Body": "The BRC-20 token standard was originally launched in March 20233 to further experiment with fungibility on the Bitcoin blockchain. Since then, the BRC-20 token ecosystem has only continued to develop, attracting both users who want to mint their own BRC-20s tokens and BRC-20 collectors who are looking to buy, sell, and trade these collectibles.\n\nLeather users can connect their wallet to multiple platforms and exchanges that list BRC-20 tokens. This, in turn, allows them to purchase BRC-20s and manage them as a wallet collectible.\n\n## Where Can I Buy BRC-20 Tokens?\n\nAs we mentioned, Leather users have multiple platforms and exchanges they can access to buy BRC-20 tokens. These include (but are not limited to):\n\n- Ordinals Wallet\n- UniSat\n- Binance\n- Kucoin\n- [Gate.io](http://gate.io/)\n- ALEX\nWhile you can connect to most marketplaces with your Leather wallet, note that exchanges like Binance and Kucoin will require you to sign up for an account with them.

Connect your Leather wallet by clicking on a ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù or ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù button located at the top right of the marketplace‚Äôs website\n1. Browse the BRC-20 marketplace\n1. Click the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button\n1. Confirm the fee options you‚Äôd like to use for your transaction and your transaction\nAfter following these steps, your BRC-20 tokens should appear in the ‚ÄúCollectibles‚Äù section of your wallet as a transfer inscription after a few minutes (though this could take longer depending on Bitcoin network traffic).\n\n### Buying BRC-20 tokens from an exchange with Leather\n\nIf you buy BRC-20 tokens from an exchange, you‚Äôll need to deposit the BRC-20 tokens into your Leather wallet following the purchase.

    "Title": "Understanding Wallet Derivation Paths",
    "Slug": "wallet-derivation-paths",
    "Body": "Simply put, a derivation path refers to a hierarchical structure that is used to derive public keys from a private key. This hierarchical deterministic (HD) key generation is commonly used to securely manage multiple wallet accounts or addresses.\n\n## Components of a Derivation Path\n\nA derivation path typically consists of a series of indices or numbers that specify the path from the main private key to a particular public key in the hierarchical structure. This is represented as a string of numbers separated by slashes that look like:\n\nm/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/0\n\nHere, ‚Äúm‚Äù stands for ‚Äúmaster key.‚Äù The rest of the path consists of the following:\n\nm/purpose‚Äô/coin_type‚Äô/account‚Äô/change/address_index\n\n## Common Derivation Paths in Leather Bitcoin Wallet\n\n### Derivation paths for Native SegWit addresses\n\nFor Bitcoin balances, Leather uses Native SegWit addresses. This means that the derivation path for Bitcoin balances in Leather follow this format:\n\nm/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/0\n\nThe ‚Äúaccount‚Äù number you see in the derivation path would increase based on the number of accounts associated with your wallet and private key. This means that if you were to create additional accounts, the derivation paths for the generated public keys would follow this convention:\n\n- Account 2 would have a derivation path of:m/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/1‚Äô/0/0\n- Account 500 would have a derivation path of:m/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/499‚Äô/0/0\n### Derivation paths for Taproot addresses\n\nFor Ordinals-related transactions, Leather uses Taproot addresses. The derivation path associated with Taproot addresses take this structure:\n\nm/86‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/0\n\nSimilar to what you‚Äôd see for Native SegWit addresses, subsequent Taproot addresses that are associated with your wallet would have a different ‚Äúaccount‚Äù number. This means that if you were to create additional accounts, the derivation paths for the generated public keys would follow this convention:\n\n- Account 2 would have a derivation path of:m/86‚Äô/0‚Äô/1‚Äô/0/0\n- Account 500 would have a derivation path of:m/86‚Äô/0‚Äô/499‚Äô/0/0\n### Derivation paths for Stacks addresses\n\nFor Stacks-related assets like STX tokens, Stacks NFTs, and SIP10 tokens, Leather uses a wallet‚Äôs Stacks address. Derivation paths for Stacks addresses in Leather look like:\n\nm/44'/5757'/0'/0/0\n\nHowever, the derivation path for Stacks addresses in Leather differs in that the ‚Äúaddress_index‚Äù value is what changes when users create additional accounts. This means that for Stacks addresses, the derivation paths for the generated public keys would follow this convention:\n\n- Account 2 would have a derivation path of:m/44'/5757'/0'/0/1\n- Account 500 would have a derivation path of:/44'/5757'/0'/0/499\n### Derivation paths for Stacks addresses in Ledger\n\nLedger devices will typically reveal the derivation path of existing Stacks addresses associated with a Leather wallet using the same convention outlined above.\n\nHowever, the derivation paths for Stacks addresses generated by a Ledger device are different than those created by the Leather extension. In this case, the ‚Äúaccount‚Äù value will change as users generate additional Stacks addresses with their Ledger device. This means that if you were to create additional Stacks accounts in Ledger, the derivation paths would normally follow this convention:\n\n- Account 2 would have a derivation path of:m/44‚Äô/5757‚Äô/1‚Äô/0/0\n- Account 500 would have a derivation path of:m/44'/5757‚Äô/499‚Äô/0/0\n## Why are Wallet Derivation Paths Important?\n\nUnderstanding wallet derivation paths is important for a number of reasons:\n\n- **Security:**The hierarchical structure of derivation paths allows you to generate multiple public keys from a single master private key. This reduces the risk of exposure, though it‚Äôs technically very difficult to[trace different accounts back to one wallet](https://leather.io/guides/account-privacy).\n- **Organization:**Derivation paths can help organize and manage multiple accounts or addresses associated with different networks.\n- **Compatibility:**Following standard derivation paths ensures compatibility with various wallets and services that support HD key generation.\nOverall, understanding derivation paths is crucial for effectively managing and securing your assets.\n\n## Viewing Accounts in Other Wallets Using Derivation Paths\n\nKnowing how to identify derivation paths can help you track different accounts associated with Leather in other wallet applications. In this case, we‚Äôll use Sparrow as an example.\n\nIn Sparrow‚Äôs ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab, you‚Äôll notice that the ‚ÄúDerivation‚Äù line under ‚ÄúKeystores‚Äù is filled in with a derivation path. This is the derivation path associated with the Leather wallet that you imported into Sparrow.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/0e903b055cb2336a59d988c81af84290.png)\n\nYou can change the numbers in the ‚Äúaccount‚Äù portion (or the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù tab if you‚Äôre looking for a Taproot or Stacks address) of the wallet‚Äôs derivation path to view the address associated with a specific account you‚Äôve created. Go to the ‚ÄúAddresses‚Äù tab after entering a derivation path value, and you‚Äôll notice that the address associated with that specific Leather account will show up.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/b36b5c06d9b6fce772d5f7b084816c26.png)\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Account privacy](https://leather.io/guides/account-privacy)\n- [Add or restore accounts](https://leather.io/guides/add-or-restore-accounts)\n- [Understanding Bitcoin address types](https://leather.io/guides/bitcoin-address-types)\n",

    "Slug": "pending-transactions",
    "Body": "It is common for users to wait anywhere from 2 to 60 minutes for a transaction confirmation. However, if your transaction has been pending for more than 2 hours, this usually indicates that traffic on the network is high and fees have increased.\n\nIn these cases, your transaction may be dropped after a certain amount of blocks or amount of time has passed. While unconfirmed transactions have no impact on a user‚Äôs wallet (the transaction never went through), users can take steps to increase the likelihood of their transactions being processed promptly.\n\n## How to Troubleshoot Pending Transactions in Leather\n\nIf your transaction has been pending for several hours, open your Leather extension and check that:\n\n### You have enough funds for the transaction\n\nEvery transaction requires the user to pay a fee on top of the original transaction balance. Paying higher fees during peak network traffic incentivizes miners to confirm your transaction promptly in upcoming blocks.\n\nA transaction could remain unconfirmed for hours if a user does not have the funds needed to cover both the transaction and the associated fee. If that is the case, you can fund your wallet and re-send the transaction if it ends up being dropped.\n\n### You‚Äôre able to reconfigure the transaction fee\n\nAdditionally, you can reconfigure the fee associated with your transaction. If your transaction has been pending for a while, selecting a higher fee will often increase the chances of your transaction being confirmed in the next block.\n\nAfter making sure that you have enough funds to cover a fee increase, click on your transaction in the ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù tab and follow these steps.\n\n### There are no nonce gaps\n\nStacks transactions in Leather use nonces to determine what order transactions are processed. These nonces are processed sequentially, meaning that a Leather account that hasn‚Äôt sent any transactions will begin at nonce 0, and subsequent transactions will be automatically set at 1, 2, 3, etc. Transaction nonces can be viewed on the[Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/transactions?chain=mainnet).\n\nIf there are gaps in the nonces associated with your account (going from 30 to 32, for example), you‚Äôll want to edit your nonce to make sure that it matches the sequence order. You can also send a completely new transaction, edit the nonce to be similar to that of a pending transaction, and set a higher fee to replace the pending transaction with your preferred nonce.\n\nPlease note that it does take time for transactions to propagate over the network, and transactions with a higher fee will replace those with a lower fee even if they share the same nonce.\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Increase transaction fee](leather.io/guides/increase-fee)\n- [Configure transaction fee](leather.io/guides/configure-transaction-fees)\n- [Configure transaction nonces](leather.io/guides/configure-transaction-nonces)\n",

There are several types of Bitcoin addresses ‚Äì each with its own unique format and characteristics ‚Äì that correspond to different types of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThis guide will help you identify different Bitcoin address types and determine which address to use depending on the transaction type.\n\n## Types of Bitcoin Addresses\n\nThe most commonly used Bitcoin address types are:\n\n### Legacy Addresses\n\n- The original Bitcoin address type that is compatible with all Bitcoin wallets and exchanges\n- Start with the number ‚Äú1‚Äù\n- Offer a high level of compatibility, though they do take up more space on the blockchain\n### Segregated Witness Addresses (SegWit)\n\n- Start with the characters ‚Äú3‚Äù\n- Supported by most modern Bitcoin wallets and exchanges\n- Offer improved efficiency compared to legacy addresses\n### Native SegWit Addresses (Bech32)\n\n- Start with the characters ‚Äúbc1q‚Äù\n- Supported by some Bitcoin wallets like Leather\n### Stacks Addresses\n\n- Start with the letter ‚ÄúS‚Äù\n- Supported by Stacks wallets like Leather and can be employed for Stacked-based transactions\n### Taproot Addresses\n\n- Start with the characters ‚Äúbc1p‚Äù\n- Supported by certain Bitcoin wallets like Leather and are frequently used for transactions involving assets that make use of Taproot, such as Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens\n## How to Find Bitcoin Address Types in Leather\n\nLeather automatically generates Bitcoin addresses for you when you create your wallet. You can view all address types associated with your wallet by clicking the ‚ÄúReceive‚Äù button on your wallet home screen.\n\nYou‚Äôll find each type of Bitcoin address listed with the corresponding asset type it‚Äôs intended for (eg. your Taproot address for Ordinals). Therefore, the ‚ÄúReceive‚Äù page serves as a dependable reference for identifying the address types to use for various transactions, whether you‚Äôre looking to buy, send, receive, or swap a token or collectible.\n\n",

    "Body": "When users create a Leather wallet, a 24-word phrase is generated. This phrase is known as a Secret Key, and users need to make sure to store this Secret Key in a place that only they can access.\n\n## What is a Secret Key?\n\nSecret Keys are more conventionally known as ‚Äúseed phrases,‚Äù mnemonic seed phrases,‚Äù ‚Äúrecovery seeds,‚Äù or ‚Äúrecovery phrases.‚Äù They‚Äôre essentially randomly generated cryptographic keys that protect a user‚Äôs crypto wallet and, consequently, the assets held within the wallet.\n\nSecret Keys generated by Leather are BIP39-compatible and in English. Technically, you can check to see if your Secret Key is compatible by cross-checking all of the generated words against[this list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt). If you‚Äôre having trouble entering your Secret Key when prompted to do so, please double check that:\n\n- All words are lowercase\n- Words are separated by only one space\n- You haven‚Äôt entered any numbers or special characters\n### Secret Keys vs. Passwords\n\nWhile users may think of Secret Keys as a password of sorts, it‚Äôs important to distinguish between the two.\n\nPasswords are unique to each device and are created by the user to access their wallet on a particular browser or computer. They are helpful if you use the same device and browser to access your Leather wallet, as they save you from having to re-enter your Secret Key every time you log in.\n\nUnlike Secret Keys, passwords can be reset and easily recovered. While there is a way to recover your Secret Key using backup data from your computer, a Secret Key is generally extremely difficult to recover once lost. It is crucial for users to keep a copy of their Secret Key in a very secure location that only they have access to.\n\nYou will often be prompted for your Secret Key if you attempt to log into your wallet from a computer or browser that you don‚Äôt normally use, or if you previously signed out from your wallet. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to make sure that you back up your Secret Key the moment it is revealed to you. You do have the ability to view your Secret Key from within the extension, but that‚Äôs provided that you can already access your wallet.\n\n## How to Secure Your Secret Key with Leather\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) offers[guidelines](https://cryptoconsortium.org/cryptocurrency-security-standard-documentation/details/)for user key storage. These guidelines are ordered from the least secure (Level I) to most secure (Level III).\n\nWe recommend that users adhere to the CCSS‚Äô Level II standards at the very least. This involves:\n\n- Backing up each of your cryptographic keys separately\n- Storing the backup in a different location from where you access your wallet (e.g. if you access your wallet from a computer located in your office, you may want to store your Secret Key in another room)\n- Storing your backup in a location that minimizes possible access by unauthorized parties (e.g. a safe or lock box)\n- Employing a tamper mechanism that helps you determine if your backup was accessed by another party\nPlease note that we do not store our users‚Äô Secret Keys, nor can we help our users recover their Secret Keys should they become lost. Leather is a self-custodied Bitcoin wallet, which means that users, alone, are responsible for their keys.\n\nThis also means that if your Secret Key has been stolen by harmful websites or software, there are no guarantees that you will be able to recover your wallet assets. Consequently, we ask that users think twice before revealing or entering their Secret Key in another application besides Leather.\n\n\n\n",

    "Body": "Alternative question:\n\nI can‚Äôt find funds (i.e. STX, BTC) displayed in Ledger Live when I try to access it with the Ledger device in Leather, why is that?\n\nIf you're using a Ledger device and trying to view your Stacks (STX) funds in Leather wallet, you may encounter some compatibility challenges. This guide explains why these issues occur, how to resolve them, and provides important details about Bitcoin addresses and their differences.\n\n## **Why Your Ledger Live Stacks Account Funds May Not Appear in Leather**\n\n### **Derivation Path Differences**\n\nLedger Live and Leather Wallet use different derivation paths to generate Stacks addresses:\n\n- Ledger Live:Account 1: m/44'/5757'/0'/0/0Account 2: m/44'/5757'/1'/0/0Account 3: m/44'/5757'/2'/0/0Additional addresses within an account: m/44'/5757'/0'/0/1, m/44'/5757'/0'/0/2, etc.\n- Leather Wallet:Account 1: m/44'/5757'/0'/0/0Account 2: m/44'/5757'/0'/0/1Account 3: m/44'/5757'/0'/0/2\nThis means that if you generate accounts or addresses using Ledger Live, they may not align with the paths used by Leather Wallet. As a result, you may not see these addresses in Leather.\n\n### **Fresh Address Generation in Ledger Live**\n\nLedger Live generates fresh addresses within an account as you use them. For example:\n\n- The first Bitcoin address in Account 1 is always the same (m/44'/0'/0'/0/0), but subsequent addresses like m/44'/0'/0'/0/1, m/44'/0'/0'/0/2 are generated dynamically.\nLeather Wallet, on the other hand, does not automatically generate new addresses beyond the initial ones. This difference affects both Bitcoin and Stacks accounts.\n\n## **Resolving Compatibility Issues**\n\n### **Stacks (STX)**\n\nIf your Stacks account is not appearing in Leather, here‚Äôs how to fix it:\n\n1. **Identify the Address in Ledger Live:**Check the address in Ledger Live where your STX is stored.\n1. **Send Funds to Leather‚Äôs Address:**In Leather, click \"Receive\" to display your Stacks address. Send your STX from the Ledger Live address to the address shown in Leather.\n1. **Monitor in Ledger Live:**Once your STX balance appears in Leather, you can add this account to Ledger Live (via \"Add Account\") for monitoring purposes. Note that this only works if the address has a balance.\n### **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n\nFor Bitcoin, the process is similar, but there are additional considerations:\n\n- **Taproot Addresses:**Taproot addresses (used for ordinal inscriptions or collectibles) require special handling. Sending or spending BTC tied to an ordinal inscription could inadvertently destroy the collectible.\n- **Separate Devices:**If you manage collectibles or inscriptions, consider using separate Ledger devices for Ledger Live and Leather accounts. This minimizes risks of accidental spending.\n## **Key Differences for Bitcoin Addresses**\n\n1. **Fresh Address Generation:**Ledger Live generates a new address once a previously generated address has been used.Leather Wallet currently does not generate new addresses automatically.\n1. **Ordinal Collectibles (Taproot):**Sending BTC tied to an ordinal inscription from Ledger Live could destroy the collectible.Always double-check before sending BTC from a Taproot address.\n## **Best Practices**\n\n- **Use Leather for STX:**Always generate Stacks addresses using Leather if you plan to use the funds there. Avoid generating Stacks addresses in Ledger Live.\n- **Monitor Balances with Ledger Live:**After transferring STX to a Leather address, you can monitor the balance in Ledger Live.\n- **Be Cautious with Taproot Addresses:**For users holding Bitcoin collectibles, avoid accessing these accounts in Ledger Live to prevent accidental spending.\n- **Separate Devices (Optional):**Consider using one Ledger device for Leather accounts and another for Ledger Live to ensure clear account separation.\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBy understanding the differences in derivation paths and address generation between Ledger Live and Leather Wallet, you can manage your STX and BTC funds seamlessly. For Stacks, always use Leather to generate addresses, and for Bitcoin, exercise caution with Taproot addresses.\n\nIf you have further questions, feel free to reach out to our support team or consult our[Derivation Path Explainer](https://leather.io/guides/wallet-derivation-paths).\n\n",

This new protocol aims to address the inefficiencies of the current Bitcoin token standard, BRC-20, particularly its tendency to produce surplus \"junk\" UTXOs, which can congest the network. The Runes protocol enhances the network by reducing unnecessary UTXOs, offering a cleaner and more efficient framework for token transactions on Bitcoin.\n\nBy leveraging UTXO-based data storage, Runes inherit Bitcoin's robust security features, making it more secure and resistant to reorganizations. This resistance ensures that Runes transactions maintain stability even as network conditions change.\n\nRunes also support the creation and management of digital tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, using native features for on-chain data storage without relying on off-chain data or special tokens. Tokens are etched, minted, and transferred using Runestones, protocol messages stored in Bitcoin transaction outputs. This protocol is set to revolutionize digital interactions on the Bitcoin network, fostering innovation and potentially enabling a variety of new activities on the blockchain.\n\n## What Can I Do with My Runes in Leather?\n\nWith the Leather wallet, you can maximize the utility of your Runes:\n\n- **Bitcoin Launchpads:**Etch, mint, and transfer Runes using various Bitcoin-based launchpads.\n- **NFT Marketplaces:**Participate in NFT marketplaces that support Runes, buying, selling, or trading digital assets secured by the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",

    "Body": "Unlike the account-based model used in traditional banking systems, which keeps track of balances in accounts, the UTXO model focuses on tracking individual units of cryptocurrency (UTXOs) as they are transferred between users.\n\n[Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)](https://leather.io/learn/utxos)are the remaining amounts of a cryptocurrency that are left over after a transaction. You can think of them like the change you receive after making a purchase.\n\nUTXOs are a core component of the Bitcoin blockchain. They help track ownership, prevent double-spending, and ensure the integrity of the entire network.\n\nBut, there‚Äôs a dark side to Bitcoin UTXOs.\n\nHaving a large number of small UTXOs can indeed lead to higher transaction fees. This is because each UTXO used as input in a transaction adds to the data size of the transaction, and fees are often based on transaction size.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs UTXOs keep breaking all-time highs, crossing[185 million](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/utxo-count)as of June 2024. This UTXO count, which was around 105 million, surged over 76% in a year, making it one of the most significant increases in UTXO count over a single year since the launch of BTC in 2009.\n\nIn this article, we‚Äôll explain what a Bitcoin UTXO is, its working model, and how Leather implements it.\n\n## What is Bitcoin UTXO?\n\nA Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is a small unit of BTC (a.k.a. Dust) that remains after a transaction. It represents a specific amount of BTC that has been authorized by a sender and is available to be spent by a recipient.\n\nWhen[Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled Bitcoin in 2009](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), BTC was the first digital currency to introduce the UTXO model. Following Bitcoin‚Äôs success, more protocols, such as Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), implemented this model.\n\nThink of UTXOs as coins in your pocket.\n\nEach coin has a specific value, and you can combine them to make a payment. Similarly, when you want to send BTC, your wallet software will select and combine multiple UTXOs to make up the desired amount. Any leftover BTC from this process is returned to you as a new UTXO (your change).\n\nJust like you can't split a physical coin, you can't split a UTXO.\n\nLet‚Äôs understand with a hypothetical transaction example.\n\nIf you have 3 UTXOs (0.5 BTC, 0.2 BTC, and 0.1 BTC) and want to send 0.6 BTC, your wallet will select the 0.5 BTC and 0.1 BTC UTXOs as inputs. The transaction will create two outputs: 0.6 BTC for the recipient and 0.2 BTC as change back to you (which becomes a new UTXO).\n\nOften, the leftover ‚Äúdust‚Äù, 0.2 BTC in our example, is ignored due to its insignificant nature (the amount is generally much smaller IRL).\n\n## Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO Model: How It Works\n\nBitcoin uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model to track ownership, transactions, and prevent double-spending.\n\nWhen you receive Bitcoin, you're essentially getting a new UTXO added to your collection. If you want to spend BTC, you need to use one or more of your existing UTXOs.\n\nBut what if you want to spend a small amount, say 0.1 BTC, but the smallers UTXO in your wallet is only 0.2 BTC?\n\nIf you need to send a smaller amount than what a single UTXO holds, your wallet will automatically select and combine multiple UTXOs to make up the right amount. Any leftover amount is returned to you as a new, smaller UTXO.\n\nEach UTXO has a history attached to it, showing where it came from and who owned it previously. This history is permanently recorded on the blockchain, Bitcoin's public ledger. This makes all transactions transparent and traceable,helping to prevent fraud and double-spending.\n\nLeather, as a Bitcoin wallet, helps you manage your UTXOs. It automatically selects the right UTXOs for your transactions, calculates any change you're owed, and ensures that your Bitcoin transactions are secure and valid.\n\nIf the UTXOs match the exact value of the required transactions, you will not receive any UTXOs in return.\n\n### UTXO Data Structure\n\nWe mentioned earlier that a large number of UTXOs add to the transaction fees as they increase data size. So, what does the data look like?\n\nEach UTXO is a data structure containing:\n\n- Transaction ID: A unique hash identifying the transaction that created this UTXO.\n- Output Index: Indicates the specific output within the transaction (since a single transaction can have multiple outputs).\n- Value: The amount of Bitcoin associated with this UTXO (in satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin).\n- Locking Script (ScriptPubKey): A small script specifying the conditions that must be met to spend this UTXO.This typically involves providing a valid digital signature proving ownership of the associated Bitcoin address.\n## How Does Stacks Implement Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO Model?\n\nStacks operates using Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model to function as a blockchain with the[finality](https://leather.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin-finality-achieving-100-bitcoin-finality-with-stacks)and security of Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain. It uses[Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/clarity/overview), a smart contract language specifically designed for predictability and security.\n\nClarity's smart contracts play a crucial role in Stacks' interaction with Bitcoin's UTXO model to manage assets and state. Clarity is also secure because its design eliminates the risks (like re-entrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, memory safety issues) associated with popularly used compiled smart contract languages like Solidity, Vyper, Rust, etc.\n\n[STX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/)is Stacks‚Äô native token, which can be used to pay transaction fees, register names, and participate in consensus. All STX transactions follow the UTXO model to execute Bitcoin-like transactions consisting of inputs, outputs, and scripts that define spending conditions.\n\n[Proof of transfer (PoX)](https://docs.stacks.co/stacks-101/proof-of-transfer)is the consensus mechanism of Stacks, which uses Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof of Work (PoW) chain as its anchor chain. This method further reinforces the link between Stacks and Bitcoin's UTXO model.\n\n## How Does Leather Implement the Bitcoin UTXO Model via Stacks?\n\n[Leather](https://leather.io/)is a wallet designed specifically for the Bitcoin Web3 ecosystem, which leverages the Bitcoin blockchain and its UTXO model. Here's how Leather implements the UTXO model:\n\n### Managing STX and BTC Tokens\n\nLeather allows its users to send, receive, and store STX tokens using supported crypto wallet addresses. STX transactions follow the UTXO model, meaning they consist of inputs (previous UTXOs the user owns) and outputs (new UTXOs created for the recipient and any change returned to the sender).\n\nSince Stacks is anchored to Bitcoin, Leather interacts with Bitcoin's UTXO set to enable BTC transactions alongside STX transactions. This integration allows users to seamlessly manage both cryptocurrencies within a single wallet interface.\n\n### Using Clarity Smart Contracts\n\nLeather enables users to interact with Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. These smart contracts can manage and transfer crypto assets represented as UTXOs on Stacks.\n\nBy adhering to the UTXO model,[Leather](https://leather.io/blog/introducing-leather-the-bitcoin-wallet-for-the-rest-of-us)ensures that assets held within Clarity smart contracts are secure and verifiable on the Stacks blockchain.\n\n### User Interface and Security\n\nLeather displays a history of STX and Bitcoin transactions, allowing users to track their UTXOs and the associated transaction details. Leather shows the user's available balance of STX and BTC, which is calculated based on the unspent UTXOs they own.\n\nThe wallet also[securely](https://leather.io/blog/how-leather-carries-out-secure-transactions)manages users' private keys, which are essential for authorizing transactions and proving ownership of UTXOs. Leather also employs encryption to protect sensitive user data and transaction information.\n\n## Take Control of Your BTC: Optimize UTXOs with Leather\n\nThe Bitcoin UTXO model, a fundamental element of blockchain technology, has far-reaching implications beyond its role in preventing double-spending. The model's influence extends to newer blockchains like Stacks, which leverages Bitcoin's security and finality through its own implementation of the UTXO model.\n\nContinuing with our ‚Äúcoins‚Äù analogy, Bitcoin UTXOs in your wallet are essentially ‚Äúloose change‚Äù and can weigh you down if left unchecked. Leather offers an intuitive and secure way to manage your UTXOs, potentially reducing fees and streamlining your transactions.\n\nBy seamlessly integrating the UTXO model for both STX and BTC transactions, Leather simplifies the management of these assets.\n\nConnect to web3 applications built on Bitcoin with the[Leather browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leather/ldinpeekobnhjjdofggfgjlcehhmanlj).

Each vault follows a predefined strategy, such as:\n\n- Writing Bitcoin call options\n- Supplying BTC to DeFi protocols\n- Allocating BTC to structured financial products\nThese vaults are implemented as smart contracts on Stacks and interact with the Bitcoin network via PoX, allowing decentralized execution and transparency.\n\n### Using Hermetica with Leather\n\nLeather users can access Hermetica directly from their wallet. You can:\n\n- View and connect to supported Hermetica vaults\n- Deposit BTC based on the selected strategy\n- Track balances and yield over time\nThis gives BTC holders access to yield without relying on centralized intermediaries or giving up control of their keys.\n\n> \n‚ö†Ô∏è Vault strategies may involve varying levels of risk, illiquidity, or market exposure.

    "Body": "Today, we introduced Leather ‚Äì a new Bitcoin wallet brand bringing Bitcoin to the rest of us.\n\nIt is the Bitcoin wallet for users who want to tap into an emerging Bitcoin economy built on trustless and decentralized technologies. We believe in making Bitcoin Web3 a welcome place where everyone feels empowered to decide when ‚Äì and how ‚Äì to use their assets.\n\nTo go with our new brand, we‚Äôre also launching a whole new brand identity that emphasizes three key components to our mission:\n\n- Making Web3 wallets more accessible and less intimidating\n- Breathing life into Bitcoin and establish it as the bedrock of Web3\n- Building a Bitcoin wallet that feels tangible and long-lasting\nWe created Leather (formerly ‚ÄúHiro Wallet‚Äù) to give Bitcoin users an avenue to put their BTC to work so that they, too, could access the growing Web3 ecosystem. Not only that, they could do so with a self-custodied wallet that gave them full control over their own Bitcoin-secured assets and online identity.\n\nThat sense of welcome familiarity and personalization is embodied in the name, Leather, itself. Much like a classic, trustworthy physical leather wallet from the Web2 world, we want Leather to bring that same sense of tangibility and reliability into the Web3 experience.\n\nFor the launch of our new brand, we collaborated with[Porto Rocha](https://portorocha.com/), a premier New York-based branding agency that has consistently pushed the boundaries with their forward-thinking designs. They have worked with some of the world‚Äôs most recognizable brands, and we were thrilled to have them on board to create a unique, distinct brand identity that aligned with our mission.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to introduce you to Leather. Let‚Äôs dive in.\n\n## Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New\n\nInspired by our commitment to building a Bitcoin wallet that can stand the test of time, our brand identity speaks to the accessibility, reliability and long-term value of Leather.\n\n### Our slogan\n\nBitcoin for the rest of us.\n\nOur new slogan is more than just a catchphrase; it‚Äôs a nod to our vision of making Bitcoin and Bitcoin Web3 a space that is easy to navigate for both new and experienced crypto users alike. Everyone should feel empowered to explore all the potential use cases being built on Bitcoin.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/f725d1c5c0a8a239998d998a7bf7ad71.png)\n\n### Wordmark\n\nThe Leather wordmark has been designed with a cursive typeface to speak to the timelessness and stability Leather users can expect to have with their wallet. It feels dynamic, digital and fluid, conveying Leather‚Äôs ease of use and our future-forward ethos.\n\n### Our symbol\n\nThe looping ‚ÄúL‚Äù is a simple, yet distinguishable symbol that conveys the uniqueness of the Leather brand in the wider Web3 ecosystem.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/659ce298505df8db1143848fe3cbf50c.gif)\n\n### Color system\n\nOur black and off-white color system gives users a sense of the precision and trust that comes with our brand. Designed to be compatible with both light and dark modes, this color system also furthers our user-friendly approach in ensuring that everything ‚Äì down to the wallet‚Äôs visual display ‚Äì is appealing in every respect.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2981c8d34de5c7ec49c0cf268e2b557c.png)\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/fa3a4946663b01ec04f9494fff4e25c5.png)\n\n### Typography\n\nOur primary typeface (March√©) is bold, confident, but also friendly to convey our dedication to being a leader in driving Bitcoin Web3 while also emphasizing the accessibility we want to give to users. Our secondary typeface (ABC Diatype) reflects the simple, yet utilitarian nature of our Leather apps.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/528b9864883d658f0511934f38b29771.png)\n\n### Illustrations\n\nOur main illustration style consists of two distinct categories: technical illustrations and stickers.\n\nOur technical illustrations represent the functionality of Leather. Our sticker illustrations add to the accessibility of our brand by showing a more colorful, fun side of Leather. Many of the stickers you see are also NFTs by artists in the Bitcoin ecosystem, creating opportunities for collaboration and community building around Bitcoin.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/586d077e2e8ae7a4a99e325306b236a9.png)\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/7c94d51c71dcb7a8a83961734dc77afb.png)\n\n### Motion\n\nCrypto and Web3 are ever evolving, and Leather is a Bitcoin wallet that moves to keep its users up to date with the latest developments on Bitcoin.\n\nThat‚Äôs why motion is a key component in much of our upcoming visual content. We want to convey to users that like Bitcoin Web3, we are dynamic, impactful and forward-thinking in what we build.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nOur new brand identity is, in many ways, a reflection of our long-term dedication to making Bitcoin Web3 a place where every user can participate in the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin. We want to be at the forefront of driving the global transition to a digital economy built on Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs oldest blockchain.\n\nWe believe that a Bitcoin wallet shouldn‚Äôt just be a user‚Äôs means to store their Bitcoin. It should be a tool that permits users to become active participants in the internet of tomorrow.\n\nThat‚Äôs why Leather isn‚Äôt just a Bitcoin wallet. It‚Äôs Bitcoin for the rest of us.\n\nConnect to web3 applications built on Bitcoin with the[Leather browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leather/ldinpeekobnhjjdofggfgjlcehhmanlj).

    "Body": "## How This Update Helps Bitcoin Ordinal Users on Leather\n\nThe implementation of Native SegWit inscription support means that Leather users can now:\n\n- Effortlessly view and send inscriptions that have been deposited to their Native SegWit addresses. This gives users a smoother experience when managing their Ordinals portfolio.\n- Get a holistic view of their Ordinals-related activity per account, regardless of whether they‚Äôve sent or received Ordinals inscriptions using their Native SegWit or Taproot addresses. Our goal is to make sure that each user has all of their activity information at their fingertips to keep track of their Ordinal transactions.\n- Import keys from other wallets that use Native SegWit for storing Ordinals and instantly view their inscriptions. This streamlines the process of consolidating users‚Äô Ordinals assets.\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/118af6088a6c6a9c0cad81d73c19abae.png)\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/138f2b7ae2a564b09d8a3b81cd3c4fd1.png)\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Ordinals: Taproot vs. Native SegWit Addresses\n\n## Understanding Bitcoin Ordinals: Taproot vs. Native SegWit Addresses\n\nIt‚Äôs not uncommon for today‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet user to be exposed to different Bitcoin address formats. Given the update, it‚Äôs important to be familiar with two of them for Ordinals-related transactions in Leather: Native SegWit and Taproot addresses.\n\n### Native SegWit addresses\n\nSegWit addresses come in two main formats: Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH), which starts with a ‚Äú3,‚Äù and Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH), which starts with ‚Äúbc1q‚Äù. P2WSH is normally used when you need more advanced scripting capabilities, such as with multi-sig wallets. P2WPKH is more commonly used for regular single-signature transactions.\n\nNative SegWit addresses are P2WPKH, which means that they start with ‚Äúbc1q‚Äù and are also backwards compatible with legacy Bitcoin addresses. Like SegWit addresses, they prioritize the separation of witness data from transaction data (like the initial SegWit upgrade). However, Bech32 is more efficient with block space because it allows for shorter and more concise representations of addresses (the public key hash is 20 bytes as opposed to 32 bytes). This results in smaller transaction sizes and, as a result, lower transaction fees for users.\n\n### Taproot addresses\n\nTaproot addresses have a ‚Äúbc1p‚Äù prefix and are compatible with SegWit (and Native SegWit) addresses. This address format is known as pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) and is a modified version of Bech32 known as Bech32m. Bech32m addresses are actually almost identical to Bech32 addresses,\n\nTaproot addresses allow for more efficient transactions with lower fees and enhanced privacy measures. This is because the P2TR address format consolidates complex smart contracts into a Schnorr signature, which can combine multiple signatures into one.\n\nBuilding for Bitcoin Addresses of All Kinds\n\n## Building for Bitcoin Addresses of All Kinds\n\nLeather users should be able to access the Bitcoin ecosystem in its entirety, regardless of Bitcoin address format. Be it legacy, SegWit or Taproot, a Bitcoin address should feel like it empowers you to explore more of the Bitcoin blockchain with your Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThis latest Leather update is just one step in our goal to expand support for different Bitcoin address types down the road. Our team is currently exploring a number of features ‚Äì like the ability to manage and generate new wallet addresses ‚Äì that could be part of Leather‚Äôs repertoire of Bitcoin user-focused capabilities down the road.\n\nAs we‚Äôve said before, a Bitcoin address type shouldn‚Äôt hinder your Bitcoin experience. It should act as another door into Bitcoin Web3.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## How Bitcoin Ordinals Work\n\nThe Bitcoin[Ordinals protocol](https://ordinals.com/)was launched in January by Casey Rodarmor. Back then, he introduced what was known as Ordinal theory ‚Äì the process of assigning numbers to each satoshi (sat), the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. Sats were numbered in which they were mined, which allowed users to track individual sats as well\n\nBut what made Ordinals take off was that each sat could be inscribed with data, be it text, audio, video or images. Not only that, but these inscriptions took the form of a Bitcoin transaction, meaning that you essentially ‚Äúminted,‚Äù so to speak, data directly on the Bitcoin blockchain itself.\n\nThis was a significant milestone for the Bitcoin community because the Bitcoin blockchain can, by design, be hard to scale and build on top of. While the Bitcoin ecosystem has developed a number of scaling solutions to circumvent these challenges ‚Äì Bitcoin L2s being one of them ‚Äì builders are still finding ways to incorporate everything from NFTs to smart contracts on the Bitcoin base layer.\n\nSo in many ways, Ordinals effectively demonstrated that there were avenues to develop on the Bitcoin L1 itself. In weeks after the protocol‚Äôs launch, Ordinals NFT collections sprung up and users clamored to ‚Äúmint‚Äù their own inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain (though let‚Äôs be clear, inscriptions generally are digital artifacts, which differ from NFTs). Now, ten months after the launch of Ordinals, developers are also experimenting with everything from recursive inscriptions to the BRC-20 token standard.\n\nThe result? According to Galaxy, Bitcoin has actually become the third most popular network for trading NFTs and remains the third most popular network for digital collectible activity.\n\nThe Ordinals Community, Then and Now\n\n## The Ordinals Community, Then and Now\n\nMore recently, there has been concern that excitement around Ordinals may be dying down. Reports that inscription transactions have decreased on marketplaces has been the largest driver of this narrative.\n\nBut what they don‚Äôt take into account is how inscriptions have still accounted for a significant fraction of transactions on Bitcoin. For example, inscriptions still made up almost half of all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain in September.\n\nNot only that, more Ordinals-related projects are still popping up. In fact, if you were at Inscribing Amsterdam, you might‚Äôve also had trouble keeping track of the number of collections and projects that are in the works (a few are listed[in this thread](https://twitter.com/jpeggler/status/1713561484930711688)). What‚Äôs more, the emergence of parent child inscriptions and rare sats have also inspired developers to explore what else they can create with Ordinals.\n\nThat is what made Inscribing Amsterdam such a crucial event for the Bitcoin community. As much as it was a gathering for artists and builders to showcase their work, it was also a gathering for the community to witness how far ‚Äì and how much farther ‚Äì they could take the Ordinals protocol.\n\nRemembering Inscribing Amsterdam\n\n## Remembering Inscribing Amsterdam\n\nWe are, truthfully, still in the early stages of unpacking what can be done with Ordinals. In his panel, ‚ÄúBeyond the Building Blocks: Building Ordinals Infrastructure,‚Äù Leather General Manager Mark Hendrickson stated that he was ‚Äúvery interested in the question of how we, as a community, can make Ordinals programmable.‚Äù\n\nDoing so, he continued, would ‚Äúincrease the scope of addressable use cases and reduce our reliance on centralized indexers.‚Äù\n\nAnd that‚Äôs just one of the many questions conference speakers and attendees had about what the Ordinals landscape could look like in the coming years. In many ways, conference attendees might‚Äôve even felt that the featured[‚ÄúAmsterdam Blooms‚Äù](https://gamma.io/ordinals/collections/amsterdam-blooms)collection was fitting, honoring Bitcoin‚Äôs past while acting as a symbol for ecosystem's ‚Äúnew beginnings.‚Äù\n\nWe were thrilled to try and answer some of these emerging questions alongside our friends at Taproot Wizards, OnChainMonkey and our Ordinals partners who have made their mark on the community. Ultimately, the Ordinals ecosystem is still in its early stages but the community, from what we could see, is dedicated to taking this crucial development to the next level.\n\nLeather: A Gateway to Ordinals\n\n## Leather: A Gateway to Ordinals\n\n[Ordinal support](https://leather.io/blog/crypto-wallets-played-a-huge-part-in-the-ordinals-inscriptions-boom)has been a priority for Leather. Since its January launch, inscriptions have already inspired a number of new protocols and technologies, along with accounting for a significant share of Bitcoin transactions. This means that users need a Bitcoin wallet that can keep up with these changes.\n\nAfter all, users‚Äô first interactions with any development in the Bitcoin ecosystem is through their Bitcoin wallet. Without a secure and versatile Bitcoin wallet, users risk missing out on the iteration of Bitcoin Web3 and the biggest projects that will come to define our ecosystem for years to come.\n\nErin Redwing, CEO of Inscribing Atlantis (organizer of Inscribing Amsterdam) has said that the event will serve as the crucial ‚Äúorigin of many foundational projects and collaborations.‚Äù We couldn‚Äôt agree more, and are excited to see how the builders and creators we met over the weekend will usher in a new era for Ordinals and Bitcoin as a whole.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is ALEX?\n\n[ALEX](https://alexgo.io/)uses the Stacks Bitcoin layer to give the next generation of Bitcoin users a versatile and easy-to-use DeFi platform. In a year where Ordinals has revived the excitement around protocols and projects developed on the Bitcoin blockchain, ALEX has stood out as a Bitcoin DeFi platform that has incorporated many of the emerging technologies in the ecosystem.\n\nFrom the[ALEX Bridge](https://docs.alexgo.io/bridge/what-is-bridge)to the[Orderbook](https://docs.alexgo.io/orderbook/what-is-orderbook)and the[BRC-20 On-chain Indexer](https://docs.alexgo.io/brc20-on-chain-indexer/what-is-the-brc20-on-chain-indexer), ALEX allows BTC users to move, swap and trade crypto assets with Bitcoin as the settlement layer (Stacks serves as the smart contract layer). All of these features come together to give users a trustless Bitcoin DeFi experience where they have full control over their digital assets.\n\nWhat Are Token Swaps?\n\n## What Are Token Swaps?\n\nIn crypto, token swaps refer to the process of exchanging one type of cryptocurrency for another, typically on a one-to-one basis. They can happen for a number of reasons, including transitioning from one blockchain network to another (or between different tokens on the same blockchain) and providing liquidity for decentralized protocols.\n\nToken swaps have allowed DeFi users to seamlessly exchange one token for another, facilitating liquidity and enabling them to participate in a wider range of DeFi services without being restricted to a single cryptocurrency. This liquidity and flexibility can allow users to optimize their DeFi strategies, access various yield opportunities and interact with a wide array of decentralized applications.\n\nAdditionally, DeFi protocols often act as building blocks that can be combined and connected to create more complex digital asset services. Token swaps allow users to move assets seamlessly between different DeFi applications, such as lending platforms and decentralized exchanges to unlock the full potential of the DeFi ecosystem. This interoperability drives innovation within the DeFi space and enables developers to create novel financial products and services that can cater to a broader range of users‚Äô needs.\n\nToken swaps have also played an increasingly larger role in Bitcoin DeFi. As builders look to expand the capabilities of Bitcoin DeFi protocols, token swaps have served as a key example of additional use cases for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-secured assets. When users connect their wallet to a Bitcoin DeFi protocol and opt to swap tokens, they‚Äôre essentially unlocking new opportunities for the BTC-based assets stored in their wallets.\n\nHow to Conduct ALEX-Based Token Swaps in the Leather App\n\n## How to Conduct ALEX-Based Token Swaps in the Leather App\n\nIf you‚Äôre already connected to ALEX via your Leather wallet account, open your Leather browser extension. You‚Äôll notice that you now have a ‚Äúswap‚Äù option in the top right corner of the Leather app‚Äôs home screen. Click on the ‚Äúswap‚Äù button to get started.\n\nYou‚Äôll then be asked to select which tokens you‚Äôd like to swap. In the example you see above, the user is converting the Stacks token (STX) to ALEX (ALEX‚Äôs governance token), so the user selects STX in the ‚ÄúYou pay‚Äù dropdown. In the ‚ÄúYou receive‚Äù dropdown, the user selects ALEX. You‚Äôll also need to enter the amount of the original token you‚Äôd like to exchange before hitting the ‚Äúreview and swap‚Äù button.\n\nThe next screen gives you a detailed breakdown of the swap itself, including the estimated confirmation time and liquidity provider fee for your transaction. Review the information and hit ‚Äúswap‚Äù.\n\nYou‚Äôll be taken to your main Leather account page. This time, if you go to the Activity tab, you‚Äôll see the swap appear as ‚ÄúPending‚Äù until the swap has been confirmed.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that these swaps are sponsored transactions, which is when one party covers the transaction fees associated with a crypto transaction on behalf of another party. In this case, ALEX signs the swap as a sponsored transaction before it is passed to the ALEX SDK library. This means that ALEX takes on the transaction fee for the user, removing an extra step for them as they conduct the swap.\n\nExplore Token Swaps in Leather Today\n\n## Explore Token Swaps in Leather Today\n\nToken swaps bring a newfound layer of versatility and utility to Bitcoin DeFi projects and the Bitcoin L1 itself. As Bitcoin evolves beyond its role as a digital store of value, tokenization and interoperability become critical components in expanding its functionality. Token swaps allow users to tap into the growing Bitcoin DeFi space, giving them access to a multitude of services and applications all while harnessing the security and resilience of the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn short, token swaps offer a gateway to unlocking the true potential of DeFi built on Bitcoin. By giving Leather and ALEX users the ability to swap tokens within the Leather app itself, we‚Äôre ensuring that users have another avenue with which they can interact with ‚Äì and contribute to ‚Äì the growth of Bitcoin DeFi.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Are Multisig Wallets?\n\nWhile a traditional crypto wallet relies on a single private key for authorization, multisignature (multisig, for short) wallets are a type of crypto wallet that require multiple private keys to authorize and complete transactions. These additional private keys give users added layers of protection against unauthorized access.\n\nNormally, multiple participants (commonly known as ‚Äúcosigners‚Äù) come together to create a multisig address. Each participant generates their own private key independently. The participants then collectively define the rules for the multisig address, including the required number of signatures (or keys) needed to validate a transaction. In this case, cosigners can be individuals, devices, or even automated scripts.\n\nSo when a participant wants to send funds from a multisig address, they would create a transaction as they would with a regular wallet. The difference here, however, is that to complete the transaction, the required number of cosigners must provide their private key signatures. If the cosigners agreed to a 2-of-3 multisig setup, then two out of three cosigners would need to use their private keys to sign off on the transaction.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Multisig?\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Multisig?\n\nMultisig wallets often reduce the risk associated with a single point of failure and offer more flexibility in setting security parameters. While we used a 2-of-3 multisig setup as a previous example, users can also opt for more complex setups (like a 3-of-5, 4-of-6 and so on). Additionally, in the event that one of the cosigners involved in the multisig setup loses their private key, the other cosigners can update the multisig rules to replace the lost key with a new one, which prevents a permanent loss of access to funds.\n\nThese extra layers of security are often why multisig wallets have a wide range of use cases, particularly in joint ventures and crypto custody services where multiple parties need to jointly manage funds. Additionally, they enable escrow services and secure trading between users by ensuring that all parties must agree to a transaction before it is executed.\n\nAsigna‚Äôs Native Stacks Approach\n\n## Asigna‚Äôs Native Stacks Approach\n\nAs we mentioned before,[Asigna](https://asigna.io/)is a native multisig solution for the Bitcoin main chain and the Stacks layer. This Stacks-native approach is key to the Asigna app, as it gives users the flexibility they need to connect to all sorts of applications without the potential security risks that can come with traditional multisig solutions.\n\nFor example, while smart contracts have been used in a good number of multisig solutions to add extra functionality, they also open the door to additional security risks. Asigna‚Äôs native architecture effectively reduces those risks by eliminating users‚Äô reliance on external smart contracts or third parties.\n\nThis same Stacks-native approach also gives users the accessibility they need to connect to apps in the Stacks ecosystem. Today, Asigna users can connect to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), NFT marketplaces and more because of the app‚Äôs compatibility with the ecosystem as a whole. This also includes infrastructure developments like sBTC, which will open up additional avenues for Asigna users to interact with the app and the Stacks layer itself.\n\nA Walkthrough of Asigna Stacks Multisig\n\n## A Walkthrough of Asigna Stacks Multisig\n\nTo get started with Asigna‚Äôs Stacks multisig platform, you can visit the[Asigna treasury](https://stx.asigna.io/)and connect your Leather wallet. Simply click on the ‚ÄúLeather‚Äù button to begin the process.\n\nYou‚Äôll be taken to the ‚ÄúStacks Treasury‚Äù page where you can view your STX balance along with your Stacks tokens.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/5771b0b0f0c05c4f7b2ec890da196f32.png)\n\nWith Asigna, you can create more than one safe for your multisig STX transactions. You can give each safe a customized name and invite the necessary cosigners for each multisig setup.\n\nCosigners are referred to as safe ‚Äúowners‚Äù once they accept your invitation.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/b0d00dd309151fca379c2401a7efa5a7.png)\n\nIf you go back to your main Stacks Treasury page, you‚Äôll also notice that you can also view and send your NFT collections and track your Stacking activities.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/49e19d70e0e94f9e569f965403dcdac2.png)\n\nTo keep track of transactions, head to the ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù tab. There, you‚Äôll find a record of all past transactions along with a status tracker that helps you keep tabs on which transactions still need confirmation from all required cosigners.\n\nOnce all cosigners have confirmed a transaction, you can hit the ‚ÄúExecute‚Äù button to complete it.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dcbba76454eb6b689c520659eee39605.png)\n\nLeather and Asigna: Your Multisig Solution\n\n## Leather and Asigna: Your Multisig Solution\n\nUltimately, our integration with Asigna‚Äôs Stacks multisig platform gives Leather users access to a native multisig solution that prioritizes security and expandability.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Asigna, you can visit their documentation page to find out more about Bitcoin multisig and Stacks multisig.\n\nTo integrate your Leather wallet with Asigna Stacks multisig today, head to the main Stacks Treasury page on the Asigna website.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "Why Focus on Ordinal Inscriptions?\n\n## Why Focus on Ordinal Inscriptions?\n\n**Elizabeth:**What made you decide to go on-chain and focus on inscriptions?\n\n**Nick:**As builders in the first Stacks ecosystem, we sort of had this thesis that there would be a future involving programmability and digital assets on Bitcoin. L2s like Stacks are certainly one way that can happen, but I think that when the Ordinals protocol came about, it was such an obvious way to be even closer to Bitcoin L1. That, of course, has always been the goal: to be as close to Bitcoin as you can possibly be.\n\nWe got started quite early. We had some test inscriptions up around inscription 600 and then, as you know, it was pretty challenging to get a full [Bitcoin node] synced up. We were, I think, the first really automated inscription service and we‚Äôve tried to really scale that up.\n\n**Hamza:**We were very aware of how Stacks worked using Bitcoin as a settlement layer, so we had that expertise and really believed in Bitcoin as a technology that could really leverage digital assets. So when we saw Ordinals, we wanted to ride the wave and explore how we could provide solutions, especially for collections and artists. The way NeoSwap really helped them was to provide smart auctions. Smart auctions help users bid on anything, and you can actually bid on as many items as you want after you set the limit for how much BTC you really want to spend. This has helped a lot of collections and we‚Äôre still having smart auctions on demand.\n\nIt has been quite exciting. We've been looking at our partners like Gamma, Leather and Xverse, and we all wanted to take part in that historical moment.\n\n**Mark:**Historically, I think a lot of folks who are working on L2s started on Bitcoin L1 and just found that there were so many limitations. You just couldn‚Äôt do many things on Bitcoin, so we were driven to go to other solutions and explore that space. But when Ordinals happened, it made us go, ‚ÄúWait, there‚Äôs an opportunity again. Let‚Äôs go back and start to connect everything.‚Äù\n\nFor years now, the whole idea was to build Web3 on Bitcoin itself, and that‚Äôs the most important thing. Ancillary technologies are just supposed to be helpful for that, but they‚Äôre not supposed to be the focus.\n\nBuilding an Ordinals Wallet and Ordinal Services\n\n## Building an Ordinals Wallet and Ordinal Services\n\n**Elizabeth:**How have you been tackling these new challenges and making sure you're first to market with support for these new technologies? Or is there another focus?\n\n**Hamza:**One of the challenges that we‚Äôre working on is the ability to swap one Ordinal for another Ordinal. We don‚Äôt have smart contracts, so we cannot make an escrow for that. We‚Äôre exploring ways we could make that work because one of the technologies that NeoSwap provides is smart swaps. Smart swaps are quite interesting because they offer a new kind of bartering process. Imagine if you could literally swap Ordinals between users, and use a very small amount of bitcoin to make that happen. We‚Äôve done that on Stacks and we may explore that with Ordinals at some point.\n\n**Nick:**It‚Äôs always about striking a balance when these new technologies come out. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs important to have a core vision and thesis in mind, and then decide which things fit within that. We‚Äôre really just trying to get a brilliant user experience and interface ‚Äì that has always been our focus. We‚Äôre all in this experimentation phase and we love trying new things, but ultimately we have to keep our eyes on the prize. It‚Äôs about the hundreds of millions ‚Äì or billions ‚Äì of people who can benefit from building on Bitcoin and using Bitcoin.\n\n**Mark:**I think in crypto there is this strong culture of being first. That‚Äôs great on one hand, [but you risk sacrificing quality]. As a result, the focus on sustainable use cases and asset types also suffers. Now, we‚Äôre seeing [a sort of] bear market in Ordinals as well, and I think that‚Äôs because we‚Äôve just got through a lot of speculative mania around Ordinals. That is natural, in some ways, for the industry, but it‚Äôs on us to mature from there and not just focus on the new hot thing.\n\nAll of our products, our arts and our assets ‚Äì what we‚Äôre building needs to stand the test of time. I hope that we actually smooth out these swings because if we don‚Äôt, it will be very hard to attract mainstream users. This is a question that I would pose to all of us: how can we approach our work a little more thoughtfully to not necessarily be first, but to produce something in the world that actually has longer-term legs?\n\nWhat Use Cases Can Ordinals Bring to Bitcoin?\n\n## What Use Cases Can Ordinals Bring to Bitcoin?\n\n**Elizabeth:**What are the use cases for Ordinals?\n\n**Hamza:**In my opinion, if there‚Äôs anything that requires durability or longevity, we definitely need to explore Ordinals. For example, say we want to digitalize the Mona Lisa and we want to do that for a longer period of time, Ordinals might make it a ‚Äúphygital‚Äù item. I believe that Ordinals can jump in for that particular use case, but we will definitely see other use cases that don‚Äôt require longevity.\n\n**Mark:**There may be moments of crisis where things happen that can threaten the existence of data. We think that if we put something online, it seems like it‚Äôll be relatively safe. [In 20 years], that might not be the case and there will be threats to digital storage. So Ordinals is, I think, the best way to say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to put something somewhere that, even in the most [dire circumstances], it will persist.‚Äù The use cases that are the most important are the ones that [can help data survive those moments].\n\n**Elizabeth:**What are you most excited about?\n\n**Mark:**I‚Äôm interested in the question of programmability. I think that to get Ordinals to the next level of sustainable use cases and value within applications, we need to figure out a way to make Ordinals programmable. There are ways to do this, whether on the Bitcoin L1 or side chains. We have to make them more programmable and move away from the situation we have now where we‚Äôre very reliant on indexers that are centralized and fragile. That‚Äôs going to unlock a lot of new use cases.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## As a Leather Bitcoin Wallet User, What Can I Do With My Ledger Device?\n\nWhen it comes to[Bitcoin transactions](https://leather.io/learn/beyond-buying-bitcoin), users can send and receive BTC using their Ledger device through the Leather interface. You‚Äôll need to set up your Ledger device beforehand (read our[user guide](https://leather.gitbook.io/guides/securing-the-wallet/using-your-ledger-device-for-bitcoin-transactions)for more) but once setup is complete, you can connect your Ledger device to complete basic Bitcoin transactions.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to receive BTC from another user, you can copy the address shown in the Leather account that is connected to your Ledger device. Since you successfully set up your Ledger device, the address you see with your Leather account should also match the address in your Ledger device.\n\nIf you‚Äôre sending BTC to another user, you‚Äôll be asked to verify a number of details within the Ledger device itself to complete the transaction with the associated account. The final transaction confirmation will take place within Leather.\n\nUsers can also use the Leather account connected to their Ledger device to buy and sell digital artifacts with some of the biggest Ordinals marketplaces. As of today, the following Ordinals marketplaces and platforms are compatible with the Leather-Ledger integration:\n\n- [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoinordinal1)\n- [Gamma](https://gamma.io/)\n- [Ord.io](https://www.ord.io/)\n- [OrdinalsBot](https://ordinalsbot.com/)\n- [Ordichef](https://ordichef.xyz/)\nWhether you‚Äôre looking to buy Ordinals, send, trade or receive inscriptions, you can now do so with the Ledger device connected to your Leather account. Especially with this year‚Äôs Ordinals boom, our users should have the option to explore Ordinals marketplaces with an additional resource that helps them securely manage new collectibles.\n\nIn addition to Ordinals platforms, you can also use your Ledger device to connect to other platforms like[ALEX](https://alexgo.io/)and[Unisat](https://unisat.io/). Users with Bitcoin Stamps collections can also use their Ledger device to connect to[Openstamp](https://openstamp.io/)and view their Stamp collection. This makes Leather the only Ledger-compatible wallet that allows users to hold Bitcoin Stamps and is part of our efforts to expand Stamps support.\n\nOf course, this is just the beginning. Our Leather team is working to give users with a Ledger device access to even more protocols and platforms in the future.\n\nWhy Integrate a Hardware Wallet With a Bitcoin Wallet Extension App?\n\n## Why Integrate a Hardware Wallet With a Bitcoin Wallet Extension App?\n\n[Hardware wallets](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-hardware-wallet)like Ledger and browser extension wallets like Leather can work together seamlessly to enhance the security of your Bitcoin holdings. A hardware wallet, as we mentioned, is a physical device that stores the private keys necessary to access your digital assets offline, which makes it highly resistant to online hacking attempts. On the other hand, browser extension wallets are software-based wallets that not only provide a convenient way to manage your assets, but their generally[self-custodial nature](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-a-self-custody-bitcoin-wallet)ensures that users also have full control over their private keys and assets.\n\nBy combining the two, users can enjoy the best of both worlds. When you initiate a transaction through a browser extension wallet, sensitive information like the transaction details and private key can be securely processed and signed within the hardware wallet.\n\nThis approach does add an extra layer of security by leveraging the strengths of both hardware and extension wallet solutions. Even if your computer is compromised, your hardware wallet can act as a safeguard that ensures your private key stays confidential. This, combined with the self-custodial nature of extension-based wallets like Leather, effectively puts you in full control of not only your own assets, but your information as you explore the wider Web3 space.\n\nBuilding a More Secure and Versatile Bitcoin Wallet\n\n## Building a More Secure and Versatile Bitcoin Wallet\n\nGiving our users the option to connect their Ledger device with our extension is another step in our goal to build the most secure and versatile[Bitcoin wallet](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-wallets).\n\nWeb3 on Bitcoin is growing, and so is the need for a Bitcoin wallet that can safely and easily give users access to this evolving ecosystem of decentralized apps. While the Leather extension app already offers users the ability to have full control over their assets and wallet activity, the added security of a Ledger hardware device is another possibility for users who want to make sure their keys and assets are protected.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a longtime Bitcoin user or new to the Ordinals scene, you can rest assured that our integration with Ledger can give you the engaging ‚Äì and secure ‚Äì experience you seek with Bitcoin Web3.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Where ‚Äì and How ‚Äì Can I See My Recursive Inscriptions?\n\nUsers may remember that recursive inscriptions appeared as black boxes in your ‚ÄúCollectibles‚Äù section.\n\nWith the latest update, users can scroll down to their ‚ÄúCollectibles‚Äù section and get a full preview of their recursive inscriptions that includes animations. In other words, we‚Äôve made it so that Leather users can see their recursive inscriptions come to life within their own wallets.\n\nData associated with recursive inscriptions is still available to users as well. Users simply need to click on their recursive inscription and they will be taken to a new tab with all the relevant information.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\n## What Are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nRecursive inscriptions are directly related to the Ordinals protocol introduced by Casey Rodarmor in early 2023.\n\nWith Ordinal theory, individual satoshis (sats) ‚Äì the smallest denomination of Bitcoin ‚Äì can be assigned a unique number that helps to identify and track each sat. Sats are numbered based on the order that they are mined and they can also be inscribed with digital content.\n\nThe ability to inscribe data to sats as Bitcoin transactions meant that users could effectively inscribe content directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. That gave rise to the popularity of Ordinal inscriptions, which became synonymous with the Bitcoin NFT landscape.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that inscriptions are inherently different from NFTs. Inscriptions are generally considered to be digital artifacts rather than non-fungible tokens, thanks to a number of criteria that Rodarmor has laid out.\n\nInitially, only 4MB worth of data could be inscribed per Ordinal (the maximum block size for Bitcoin transactions. The advent of recursive inscriptions, however, expanded the inscription limit and paved the way for more complex projects on Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Are Recursive Inscriptions?\n\n## What Are Recursive Inscriptions?\n\nRecursive inscriptions essentially help users break free of the 4MB data limit by calling on data from prior inscriptions. Users can basically daisy-chain data through a series of calls, which allows them to exceed the 4MB data limit by reducing the amount of data needed to add to each satoshi.\n\nWhile developers are still in the early stages (relatively speaking) of experimenting with recursive inscriptions, there are a number of projects that have already made use of the technology. For example, OnChainMonkey used recursion to inscribe collections like OCM Dimensions. Recursions allowed them to mint animated 3D inscriptions under 1KB in size adding another dimension, so to speak, to what inscriptions could be.\n\nAnd art, according to proponents of recursive inscriptions, is just the start. By minimizing the volume of data that can be inscribed on each sat, recursions have expanded Ordinals-related use cases and reduced transaction costs. This includes everything from permissionless contracts to more complicated projects like video games, expanding the possibilities of what can be built on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nYour Recursive Inscriptions Are on Full Display With Leather\n\n## Your Recursive Inscriptions Are on Full Display With Leather\n\nLeather users should be able to interact with the Ordinals ecosystem as it grows. Our latest update is just another step in making Leather the go-to Bitcoin wallet for Ordinal collections.\n\nUltimately, we‚Äôre connecting users to the latest developments of Bitcoin Web3. Ordinals are just a piece of the wider Bitcoin Web3 puzzle, albeit an important one that represents a big milestone for the Bitcoin community.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Do Ordinals Have To Do With Art?\n\nOrdinal Theory is a numbering system for satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. These numbers are unique, trackable, and vary in rarity, demand and value.\n\nBut Ordinals really took off because of inscriptions. The ability to inscribe information to files ‚Äì whether they be an image, an audio file, video or otherwise ‚Äì directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain generated significant excitement from the community. These inscriptions, known as digital artifacts, have generated a huge market of interest in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nDigital Artifacts or NFTs?\n\n## Digital Artifacts or NFTs?\n\nTechnically speaking,[digital artifacts](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-digital-artifacts-bitcoin)and non-fungible tokens aren‚Äôt the same thing. Although the two concepts are similar and many have been using them interchangeably, there are key differences to consider.\n\n[Ordinal inscriptions](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals), for example, occur directly on the blockchain. Many NFTs are stored off-chain or as part of a more centralized chain, such as Ethereum or Solana. Inscriptions don‚Äôt use smart contracts and therefore do not have separate metadata. NFTs are typically activated by on-chain smart contracts. These seemingly small differences provide extra security to those who hold digital artifacts, as they are settled directly on Bitcoin.\n\nMuch of the early excitement surrounding the ability to create these digital artifacts had to do with increased use cases for Bitcoin. People saw the potential for Ordinals to expand the scope of how others viewed the protocol and move it toward a future where it is seen as more than just a digital asset.\n\nHow Does OP_CAT Come Into Play?\n\n## How Does OP_CAT Come Into Play?\n\nOP_CAT, a long-dead opcode from the earliest days of Bitcoin, has been back in the conversation in recent months. This is mainly due to Taproot Wizards, the company behind the Quantum Cats collection. This series of Bitcoin inscriptions has generated an enormous amount of attention, selling out its first collection of more than 3,000 images and netting $13M. The demand has been significant, with some dubbing it a frenzy.\n\nTaproot Wizards‚Äô success in the digital art market has put OP_CAT and recursive inscriptions back in the spotlight. Supporters of resuscitating OP_CAT believe it could allow for smart contract-like features and bridges to L2, expanding the opportunities to create, store and trade Bitcoin-native digital artifacts. While OP_CAT has its supporters and its detractors, its potential for changing the way digital artifacts are made has been a recurring topic of conversation.\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Make Art on the Blockchain?\n\n## What Does It Mean to Make Art on the Blockchain?\n\nThe question of what constitutes art isn‚Äôt a new one. A simple search will turn up endless think-pieces on art‚Äôs definition, its categories and the question of who determines what qualifies. The popularization of NFTs over the past few years has served to expand that conversation into the blockchain space.\n\nWhile detractors have criticized NFT art as unserious, overhyped or too easy to make a copy of, there‚Äôs no denying that it has demonstrated commercial appeal to collectors. A 2021 auction through art house Christie‚Äôs netted[$69 million for a Beeple NFT](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million)‚Äì by contrast, an original Monet painting titled Nymph√©as went for[$15 million less](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html)in 2014.\n\nThe Beeple sale came during a high point for consumer interest in NFTs, and there‚Äôs no denying that there have been changes in market value for many collections since then. But it‚Äôs equally fair to note that there is still significant demand for digital artifacts.\n\nThe success of Quantum Cats alone demonstrates the potential for inscription art to become an even bigger player in the digital art space. But they‚Äôre not the only ones. There have been Ordinal inscription shows at Miami Art Week and art house Sotheby‚Äôs has entered the market. Late last year, they sold BitcoinShrooms NFTs for a whopping $450,000, and the Genesis Cat inscription alone brought in over $250,000.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth acknowledging how we got here. While Ordinals have simplified the creation of digital artifacts, Bitcoin NFTs were around long before it. Builders have been working to bring NFTs to Bitcoin for a decade, starting with Counterparty and more recently through Bitcoin layers like Stacks. Because Bitcoin NFTs required a layered solution to build, those looking to mint NFTs through Bitcoin had to contend with less native infrastructure than that of other chains. The growing ecosystem of art we‚Äôre seeing on Bitcoin‚Äôs base layer today is a direct result of the longtime efforts of a determined builder culture.\n\nConclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, the question of what it means to make digital art can be broken into two subsections: what is art, and how is it made? While people can hold different views on the role inscriptions should play in the digital art sphere, there is no denying that the introduction of so-called Bitcoin NFTs has shaken up the marketplace for creators and collectors alike.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## The Intersection of Bitcoin Ordinals and Bitcoin Education\n\n**Leather: How did you begin creating Web3 art?**\n\n**Paz:**I started during the pandemic in 2021. At the time, I had a few friends who were creating Web3 art and I got into NFTs.\n\nBut I didn't create my own pieces until Ordinals came out. That was mainly because at the time, the NFT market was really saturated and I liked the fact that Ordinals were on-chain and would last for basically as long as Bitcoin lasts. It was a new space that allowed for new upcoming artists, so I went for it.\n\n**Leather:****What inspired you to make Ordinal Faces?**\n\n**Paz:**First, I want to give a shout-out to my co-creator Bones World. Ordinal Faces was a collaboration between us. He was the one who designed the actual faces, and I was the one who added the visual effects to make them into glitch art.\n\nOrdinal Faces is a collection of 50 pixel art faces that kind of resemble an old digital style of art. It was inspired by two things: the first was everything that was being inscribed at the time, which felt like very retro-style inscriptions. We wanted to add to that by creating a very retro punk style collection. The second was a design that my co-creator made for his own brand a year prior. We pretty much based the whole collection off of that design.\n\n**Leather:****What sort of message did you want to get across with Ordinal Faces?**\n\n**Paz:**We wanted to focus on the intersection of Bitcoin education and art. I wanted to show that it's fairly easy for any artist to come into the space, make their own art, and inscribe it. With NFTs, I feel like the process can be pretty hard and it's not something that's stored forever like Ordinals are.\n\n**Leather:****Why is Bitcoin education important to you?**\n\n**Paz:**I think being able to have something that lives on long after we‚Äôre gone is really valuable. I hope that if people also see the value in that, they would be interested in inscribing their own art.\n\n**Leather:****What is one thing that people often don't know about your project?**\n\n**Paz:**We were the second-ever gif collection within Ordinals. The file sizes were pretty large in terms of what people inscribe now as we were inscribing upwards of 200 kilobytes per file, and that was mostly because the pieces were in gif form.\n\nWe haven't really publicly stated that we're making continuing designs for Ordinal Faces, but it is on our minds. If we do it, we would want to do it well.\n\n**Leather:****What are some things that you want to experiment with?**\n\n**Paz:**I think a pretty cool thing would be to do something with block numbers, something like having the art change with the block number. So perhaps an Ordinal Face that changes with time. But at the same time, I think simplicity is always good. So, who knows?\n\nWe're in a state that nobody has really seen before, and I'm just excited to see how people react to Ordinals and the new tech that is going to be built off of it. It's not just going to be images or art, I think it'll be much more. It definitely has a lot of promise.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## The Core of Leather‚Äôs Security: Self-Custody\n\nLeather is an open-source self-custodial wallet. This means that its code is open for the public to view and users retain access to their private keys (known as Secret Keys in the app).\n\nSince Leather is a hot wallet, a user‚Äôs private keys are stored on the device on which the wallet has been installed.\n\nLeather initially used PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to encrypt and store users' keys. It's a way to turn a password into a cryptographic key to encrypt data. This method relies heavily on the processing power of a computer's CPU to create the key.\n\nLeather was updated to use a different method called Argon2id to improve security. Argon2id makes it more difficult for attackers to guess passwords, even with powerful computers. This change means that when users set a password for their wallet, it's turned into a key in a much safer way.\n\nIntegration with Ledger Hardware Wallets\n\n## Integration with Ledger Hardware Wallets\n\nLeather gives you an extra layer of protection with its integration with Ledger hardware wallets. With Leather, you can have the convenience of a software wallet with the security of a hardware wallet.\n\n[Leather users can connect their Ledger devices](https://leather.io/blog/break-out-your-ledger-device-to-securely-manage-bitcoin-and-ordinals-transactions)directly to the Leather wallet, adding to the security of their Bitcoin and Stacks transactions.\n\nThe integration allows users to perform a variety of transactions securely, such as sending and receiving Bitcoin (BTC), managing Ordinals, and interacting with the broader[Bitcoin web3](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-bitcoin-web3)ecosystem.\n\nSupport for Multisig\n\n## Support for Multisig\n\nIn the last quarter of 2023, Leather began supporting Asigna, a native multisig solution tailored for Bitcoin and Stacks, to enable multisig support.\n\nMultisig is a digital signature scheme requiring multiple keys to authorize a cryptocurrency transaction. Instead of relying on a single key (and thus a single point of failure), multisig involves several keys. This multi-level approach increases security as a transaction needs more than one party‚Äôs approval before execution.\n\nLeather Wallet supports multisig for Stacks transactions ‚Äî a particularly useful feature for organizations or groups where management of funds requires consent from multiple stakeholders.\n\nLeather‚Äôs Longtime Dedication to Wallet Security\n\n## Leather‚Äôs Longtime Dedication to Wallet Security\n\nWhile Leather has gradually introduced features that emphasize wallet security, it‚Äôs also important to highlight that the team behind Leather has a long track record of addressing wallet vulnerabilities over the years. The resolution of security vulnerabilities is crucial for any wallet, as many of these potential hazards can put users at risk.\n\nUsers have access to[a full guide](https://leather.gitbook.io/guides/securing-the-wallet/past-audits-vulnerabilities-and-solutions)detailing key highlights from Leather‚Äôs security audits. Some highlights, however, include the following:\n\n### Preventing private key caching by browsers\n\nIn a previous code audit for Leather, Least Authority revealed that a ‚Äúdemonic vulnerability‚Äù existed, a security issue[common across several browser-based crypto wallets](https://www.halborn.com/disclosures/demonic-vulnerability).\n\nThe presence of this vulnerability meant that browsers would cache a wallet‚Äôs secret keys in their local storage. Since the keys were now stored in an accessible location, users‚Äô private keys could be exposed, allowing outside parties to potentially reconstruct them from the browsers‚Äô cache.\n\nLeather addressed the demonic vulnerability by[implementing a fix](https://github.com/leather-wallet/extension/commit/108fdf865e00b545f29f8fca15e7a7869a8da097)to prevent the caching of secret keys in browser local storage.\n\nBy ensuring users‚Äô private keys are not stored in their browser‚Äôs cache, attackers can no longer exploit them for transaction authorizations. This approach is somewhat unique as it specifically targets the security risks associated with browser-based local storage.\n\n### Encrypted key phrase when not in use\n\nAs detailed in Leather‚Äôs security report, the \"Plain Text Password Handling\" issue in Leather involved users‚Äô Secret Keys being stored in their browser‚Äôs memory in cleartext.\n\nThis posed a serious security risk as potential attackers could dump the extension process memory and steal a user‚Äôs Secret Key phrase, allowing them to take control of a wallet and all its assets.\n\n[Leather fixed the plain text password handling issue](https://github.com/leather-wallet/desktop/commit/bb71f4f051002b92f5f4509f573d8d59a3a868a0)by introducing a function named‚ÄòblastUndoStackToRemovePasswordFromMemory‚Äô.\n\nThe function is designed to remove the password from memory shortly after its use. It works by clearing the undo stack in the browser, which can potentially hold previous values of the input fields, including passwords.\n\nThis approach helps to ensure that sensitive data like passwords are not left in memory where malicious actors might access them.\n\n### Uniform locking mechanism\n\nIn a previous version of Leather, if a user had the wallet open in multiple tabs or windows, locking their account in one browser or tab didn't lock it in the others. The wallet remained accessible and, therefore, vulnerable in windows and tabs that were still open.\n\nLeather resolved this issue by ensuring that when the wallet is locked in any one window or tab, it automatically locks and closes in all others, enhancing overall security.\n\nThis directly impacts transaction security. By ensuring the wallet locks simultaneously in all instances, Leather prevents unauthorized access and potential misuse in one of the still-open tabs or windows.\n\nThis uniform locking mechanism maintains the integrity and security of transactions by minimizing the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.\n\nUse Leather For Your Bitcoin Transactions\n\n## Use Leather For Your Bitcoin Transactions\n\nAny crypto user needs a wallet that prioritizes security, offers robust encryption, and has regular upgrades.\n\nWallet security is one of the many reasons why Leather is open-source. Leather‚Äôs code is available to the public as proof of security, and the community, at large, can find bugs and suggest fixes before attackers exploit them.\n\nThis community-based effort continues to be a cornerstone of Leather‚Äôs development. Together, we're working towards building a more versatile ‚Äî and secure ‚Äî Bitcoin wallet that caters to users from all walks of life.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Building a Global Community with Bitcoin Ordinals\n\n**Leather: How did you begin your creative journey?**\n\n**Tosyo:**My mother and sister actually did fine art. I expressed art in a different form, more specifically through photography and filmmaking. I did have some mentors and I was fortunate enough to work for a newspaper company where I was initially training to be a fashion photographer. I was always fond of capturing the moment, so to speak, ever since I was young, and that's how I eventually found out that I loved art.\n\n**Leather: What inspired the creation of BitcoinWhales?**\n\n**Tosyo:**So I had this idea where I wanted to build a safe haven for a community that everyone would actually benefit from. I was applying to join a Bitcoin startup accelerator, but I decided not to apply and just focus on building culture. Ordinals made Bitcoin fun again, and culture plays a huge role when it comes to retention or keeping individuals engaged with the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n[BitcoinWhales](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWhales_)was the perfect name for this project because often we see Bitcoin ‚ÄòWhales‚Äô as big players in the space, or a person who has a lot of bitcoin. But with Ordinals, everyone can be part of a community regardless if they're actually a Whale or not.\n\n**Leather: Why did you choose Ordinals?**\n\n**Tosyo:**When I discovered Ordinals and started to learn everything about it, it definitely made sense to start a community in Bitcoin because Bitcoin is where scarcity and immutability exists, and it exists within Ordinals. So I figured I wanted to make a long-lasting community that works well and whose digital collectibles or assets can be passed down from generation to generation, and it would be on Bitcoin because the art is inscribed on-chain.\n\n**Leather: You‚Äôve recently started a project, Culture Pods, aimed at preserving and promoting local art in different communities around the world. How did that come about, and what will it look like?**\n\n**Tosyo:**I got to connect with an amazing individual and we share the same vision. They‚Äôre based in Singapore while my home country is the Philippines. We wanted to promote mass adoption in a different lens. Our aim here is to embrace different cultures and preserve their cultural heritage one block at a time.\n\nWhat I hope in the future is for different nations or cultures to embrace Culture Pods, because what our partnership entails with Bali is that they're utilizing our IP to integrate their cultural art with BitcoinWhales. It also helps create exposure for local artists. This may be the first time these artists are discovering Bitcoin Ordinals, so one of the things that I hope is that we have a global network in the future.\n\n**Leather: What would you say to artists who are curious about joining the Bitcoin community and creating Ordinals?**\n\n**Tosyo:**There's no perfect time, but they are welcome to join BitcoinWhales at any moment because we‚Äôre still in our early stages. There's also a lot of time for creators to get in on Ordinals because that broader ecosystem is still in its early stages as well.\n\nI think Ordinals is the best way to get into Bitcoin. It allows people to explore the Bitcoin community in an easy, frictionless way.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Celebrating Bitcoin ‚Äî and Ordinals ‚Äî with Bitcoin Burials\n\n**Leather: How did you get started as a creator, and how did you eventually decide to explore Web3?**\n\n**Cadel:**I mined my first bitcoin in February 2011 on an ATI Radeon 5770 on Slush Pool after reading about it in a technical publication. When the first payout settled and I could see the transaction and unspent output in my wallet, I was hooked. That chance encounter led to a lifelong passion for crypto, initially embodied solely by Bitcoin. Over time, my focus shifted toward Ethereum due to the myriad opportunities and possibilities offered by smart contracts.\n\nAfter almost half a decade spent on ETH and its Layer 2s, I started to experience burnout from the complexities of its constantly evolving ecosystem. When I heard about Ordinals back in February 2023, I found them to be a breath of fresh air. And once I realized the on-chain nature of inscriptions, my love for Bitcoin was rekindled. I found it to be a kind of safe harbor. That‚Äôs how I ended up back on the mother-chain.\n\n**Leather: Tell us about the Bitcoin Burials project and the inspiration behind it**.\n\n**Cadel:**The impetus behind Burials was our desire to inscribe every time some clueless pundit, economist, politician, banker or the media at-large declared Bitcoin dead. We took all the obituaries curated over the years by 99bitcoins and put them on-chain inside EXIF data that‚Äôs embedded in the images themselves. Each headstone is carved with a date on which Bitcoin supposedly died and has the relevant obituary embedded inside.\n\nIt‚Äôs just a testament to Bitcoin's resilience over the years, making fun of the naysayers. Our journey was guided from the start by a desire to shame for all eternity the no-coiners who ‚Äì at every step ‚Äì predicted and cheered for Bitcoin's demise. What better way to immortalize their word-salads and inane ramblings than storing them on the most decentralized and resilient data storage layer in the world? Bitcoin itself.\n\nIt's a collection that is steeped in history and lore ‚Äì one that even Laser Eyes who are now cautiously opening up to Ordinals would find appealing. Or, at least, it‚Äôs the one they would hate the least.\n\nThe sheer perseverance of public figures who are hellbent on declaring Bitcoin dead ensures we will be forever relevant. The fact that we documented all the obstacles and tumultuous periods Bitcoin had to navigate (and ultimately overcome) to become the battle-tested and hardened value and data storage network it is today makes us uniquely positioned in the Ordinal space.\n\n**Leather: What impact do you ultimately hope to have with the collection?**\n\n**Cadel:**By storing the metadata for the entire collection as EXIF (an open and interoperable standard with plenty of tooling available that caters to it), we underscored the importance of trust minimization in the role that creators play. Also the disproportionate amount of control that launchpads/marketplaces, explorers and aggregators play in the ecosystem to this day. No one should have to sling around a json off-chain to get trait-filtering. With our solution, relevant parties can collate it themselves from publicly available, on-chain data.\n\n**Leather: How do you think this collection pushes the envelope when it comes to exploring more use cases on Bitcoin?**\n\n**Cadel:**With Burials, we‚Äôve come up with a unique and ingenious way to store metadata inside the image itself. We won‚Äôt claim we‚Äôre geniuses here as in the end, we just repurposed a very old and decidedly Web2 standard, EXIF. We used it to embed the metadata inside the asset itself in a way that is easy to parse and display (and human-readable, to boot). It may look like a small improvement, but it unleashes myriad use cases and strongly enhances our ability to fulfill what is ultimately the raison d'etre for NFTs.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to trust us in any way, shape or form. Heck, you don‚Äôt even need to rely on our continued existence. We can get hacked, we can stop paying bills for critical infrastructure or simply disappear ‚Äì not that we ever would ‚Äì and our collectors will still be able to fully enjoy the collection for as long as Bitcoin itself keeps ticking along.\n\n**Leather: You‚Äôve also recently introduced a**[Rune](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-runes)**mining initiative. What are your thoughts on Runes and why will Runes be so important for Bitcoin?**\n\n**Cadel**: We believe Runes will play a pivotal role in finally proving Bitcoin as a viable L1 protocol capable of supporting a thriving fungible tokens ecosystem comparable to that of EVM chains. Runes have significantly less overhead compared to currently deployed and widely used metaprotocols such a BRC-20 and eliminate a lot of the pain points leading to the high friction UX that has prevented Tokens from truly flourishing on BTC.\n\nThe credibility and the weight stemming from having Casey‚Äôs name attached to the project will almost certainly mean that the industry will converge into widely supporting Runes, and tooling for etching and transacting Runes is already being built even before the protocol is officially deployed. Another key differentiator that bodes well for Runes is that they also impose less strain on the mempool and limit the proliferation of UTXOs leading to a much healthier network.\n\nWe recognize how big of a game changer Runes are poised to become and as a such we plan to launch our very own Rune token that will play an integral part in the Burial ecosystem. Holders can already mine it by pairing up a Boney and a Burial from our two existing collections and inscribing a standalone miner generating runes that will be claimable as soon as the protocol goes live in late April.\n\n**Leather: What is one thing people often don‚Äôt know or realize about the Bitcoin Burials project?**\n\n**Cadel:**In addition to cosmetic traits, we also have more than 400 unique dates carved on the Burials. Many of these feature cameos and callbacks to notable events. Many people try to hunt for the right Burial, so to speak, that features a date they have a deep personal connection to. This could be due to a notable event in their life, be it a birthday, achievement or special memory. We also share the same artist as Bitcoin Frogs, so every Burial holder was able to mint the next PFP project from said artist for free on February 21.\n\n**Leather: In your opinion, what are the most important features and priorities for a Bitcoin wallet to have?**\n\n**Cadel:**Security should definitely be paramount, followed closely by a frictionless UX. For an Ordinal-centric wallet like Leather, what I appreciate most is the ability to aggregate assets that are native to many different standards ‚Äì such as Stamps ‚Äì all together. One thing we would love to see is the ability to group or index assets together that belong to a single collection. This would ease the fruition process and make perusing one‚Äôs holdings more seamless for collectors with sprawling ordinal menageries.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is a Bitcoin Burner Wallet?\n\nA Bitcoin burner wallet is a temporary address with a new private/public key pair. This private key is not linked to your main wallet. You can use this wallet for a specific transaction or purpose (like trading), without revealing your details.\n\nThis way, burner wallets break the connection between addresses, transactions, and personal identity ‚Äî offering privacy and security. And once the transaction or purpose is complete, the wallet can be safely disposed of or \"burned\".\n\nHow Does a Bitcoin Burner Wallet Work?\n\n## How Does a Bitcoin Burner Wallet Work?\n\nBurner wallets are made by creating new accounts in your existing wallet. Each account has a separate private/public key.\n\nHowever, your primary and burner wallets have the same seed phrase (Leather uses the term Secret Key to refer to see phrases), meaning you can use it to recover both of them. However, the funds stored in them are managed independently even though the same underlying seed technically connects both wallets.\n\nLeather uses a Hierarchical deterministic (HD) model which allows you to manage and create multiple accounts using a single Bitcoin wallet or seed phrase. The HD wallet model makes private/public key management simpler. In HD wallets, the master seed phrase also acts as a backup as it can recover all the private/public keys attached.\n\nWith[Leather](https://leather.io/), you can have multiple sub-wallets for different purposes, all derived from the same master seed phrase. For example, you can have one wallet as the main account, holding most of your Bitcoin for long-term savings. Another wallet can be your Bitcoin trading account, which you use to trade, pay people and conduct other transactions actively. And finally, you can have one or many burner wallets for private and secure transactions and one-off interactions with dApps.\n\nWhy Do Some Users Opt for a Bitcoin Burner Wallet?\n\n## Why Do Some Users Opt for a Bitcoin Burner Wallet?\n\nThe main security risks with any wallet come from your private key, which controls the ability to spend funds. Private keys can be stolen by phishing, malware, remote access of devices, or hacking of wallet providers. These keys are also prone to such risks, especially when transacting with new platforms like a DEX (decentralized exchange) or an NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace.\n\nThe advantage of using a burner wallet is that even if your private key is compromised, the impact is localized to the holdings in that temporary address.\n\nTherefore, a Bitcoin burner wallet secures high-risk transactions by limiting exposure to your primary, long-term wallet. If you want to explore new dApps, anonymize Bitcoin payments, etc., consider using a Bitcoin burner wallet.\n\nBenefits of Using a Bitcoin Burner Wallet\n\n## Benefits of Using a Bitcoin Burner Wallet\n\nBitcoin burner wallets offer benefits such as privacy, temporary storage, testing, anonymity, and so on. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how a burner wallet helps with each one.\n\n- **Privacy:**Burner wallets allow receiving payments without tying transactions or revealing users' portfolios.\n- **Temporary storage:**Burner wallets are ideal for temporary and short-term storage of Bitcoin that one does not intend to hold for long periods.\n- **Testing:**For developers, burner wallets provide a sandbox environment for safely testing dApps (decentralized applications). Developers can interact with new smart contracts, taking on minimal risk.\n- **Anonymity:**For specific individuals like investigative journalists or political activists, burner wallets help minimize the traceable on-chain footprint.\n- **Localize risk:**Burner wallets localize risk to a specific address while participating in high-risk activities like airdrop farming or NFT minting. Phishing, airdrop scams, and other malicious efforts are more likely to happen during such activities.\nHow to Create & Manage a Burner Wallet on Leather?\n\n## How to Create & Manage a Burner Wallet on Leather?\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on creating a burner wallet using Leather, the leading Bitcoin wallet.\n\n### Step 1: Log in to your Leather Wallet\n\nLog in to your[Leather](https://leather.io/)wallet and click on your main account's name. This is usually listed as \"Account 1\" by default, but in this example it is \"carey.btc\" as you can also use Bitcoin domain names you've claimed in Leather.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/733c206f23bd8ffcf4efea1d2d34f457.png)\n\n### Step 2: Click on \"Create new account\"\n\nNow, click on \"Create new account\", and you will have a new address with a new private key and public address.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/7c7bfd1f664aa34a091c2bea444df918.png)\n\nThis account can now be used as your burner wallet.\n\nRemember that both your primary and burner wallets are derived from the same mnemonic Secret Key. Hence, secure the Secret Key as safely as possible.\n\nBonus: Private Keys for a Specific Address\n\n## Bonus: Private Keys for a Specific Address\n\nExtracting a private key for a specific address allows you to have granular control over a single address and be more secure. You can use this private key to migrate funds of your burner wallet to another wallet, or integrate it with dApps that need your private key.\n\nThis[Leather guide](https://leather.gitbook.io/guides/bitcoin/getting-an-address-private-key)covers the entire process of extracting the private key for your burner wallet using Electrum.\n\nStay Anonymous With Bitcoin Burner Wallets\n\n## Stay Anonymous With Bitcoin Burner Wallets\n\nBitcoin burner wallets are an excellent tool for users dabbling around the Bitcoin ecosystem and trying out new dApps and protocols. Burner wallets are ideal for one-time and anonymous Bitcoin transactions.\n\n[Leather](https://leather.io/)provides a simple, easy-to-navigate interface to create new burner wallets and transact with them while offering enhanced security. Wallet security is one of the highest ‚Äî if not the highest ‚Äî priority for many of our users, and we want to give them a number of options to protect their assets as they engage with the Bitcoin network.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Are Runestones?\n\nThere are two key pieces to the Runestones project: the Runestones Runes Ordinal and the Runestones Token.\n\n### Runestone Ordinals\n\nRunestones aren‚Äôt just any piece of art in the blockchain ecosystem. The Runestone was designed by sculptor L√©o Caillard, who is known primarily for his work with marble. Caillard reportedly donated the image to the Runestone project under a Creative Commons license.\n\nCaillard[called](https://twitter.com/leocaillard/status/1765052114533826770)working with Bitcoin ‚Äúnot so different from the enduring nature of marble,‚Äù and says his design ‚Äúis a statement about the permanence of art, whether carved from the earth or coded into the ether.‚Äù\n\nAs the stated goal was to reward those who adopted Ordinals early-on, eligibility was key to implementation. It was decided that a Runestone Ordinal would be dropped to any Bitcoin address that held three (or more) non-text or JSON script Ordinals before block 826,600.\n\nThe Runestones team used parent-child relationships to build non-utility inscriptions that also guarantee on-chain provenance. The way this works,[according to Leonidas](https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1699551401775415329), is that ‚Äúif you own an inscription you have the ability to create ‚Äòchildren‚Äô inscriptions under it, thus making it the ‚Äòparent‚Äô of those inscriptions.‚Äù\n\nEach of the collection‚Äôs inscriptions (over 112,000 total) originated from a[‚Äúchild‚Äù](https://www.ord.io/63026232)inscription derived from a[‚Äúgrandparent‚Äù](https://www.ord.io/63140674)that is, to date, the[largest inscribed file on Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1772652290903613694?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet). This grandparent inscription was sold for 8 BTC in a Dutch auction to cover the fees needed to complete the airdrop. The \"child\" inscription (designed by[FAR](https://leather.io/blog/from-taproot-wizards-to-generative-ai-q-a-with-far), co-creator of Taproot Wizards) was transferred to Satoshi's address as part of a \"burn\" mechanism to ensure that no additional Runestones could be created. By using this method, the cost of inscribing and air-dropping to all eligible addresses came to roughly $0.88 per recipient.\n\n### Runestone Tokens\n\nUltimately, the stated main purpose of the Runestone Ordinal is to serve as a placeholder for the launch of a Runes Token. The creation of this token will utilize Runes, a new fungible token protocol developed by Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor. Runes will offer a more efficient alternative to the BRC-20 token standard and is set to launch after the fourth Bitcoin halving (occurring at block 840,000). It is expected to allow for more seamless transactions and swaps.\n\nAs of this writing, the Runestone community has yet to decide on the exact supply and ticker for the upcoming Runes Token. However, the Runestone project‚Äôs leaders have determined that the token will also have a scheduled fair launch that follows the same principles as the Runestones Ordinals launch.\n\nWhat Is the Goal Behind Runestones?\n\n## What Is the Goal Behind Runestones?\n\nThe Runestones project has two primary goals: to reward those who adapted to Bitcoin Ordinals early in the game, as well as to change the way we look at standard NFT frameworks. This meant avoiding traditional elements like farming and presales, focusing instead on equitability and rewards. Leonidas has[stated](https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1766039968856637748)that its open-source eligibility algorithm was specifically ‚Äúdesigned to not favor whales.‚Äù\n\nBut Runestones aren‚Äôt just about seeing who can get their foot in the door fastest. From its earliest days, community engagement has been an essential part of the project‚Äôs ethos. ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãRemember that you earned your Runestone by showing up and participating in Ordinals when nobody else did,‚Äù[Leonidas wrote on X](https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1768380400152314295?s=20). ‚ÄúThis was the only way to get a Runestone.‚Äù\n\nThe nod to those who have earned a Runestone wasn‚Äôt lip-service. A huge element of the collection is its democratization. By design, there were no team allocations or pre-sales for major collectors. Instead, Leonidas sought to reward those who participated in Ordinals during its first year, and he focused on creating a 100% volunteer environment.\n\n‚ÄúI tweeted the idea‚Ä¶ to do a massive airdrop to reward the year one Ordinals community,‚Äù Leonidas previously told Decrypt. ‚ÄúOver ten different companies in the Ordinals ecosystem have donated funds, engineering resources, etc., to help make it happen,‚Äù he added.\n\nLeonidas has not been shy about the logic underpinning Runestones. As they[wrote on X](https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1760891842646757522), ‚ÄúThe primary use case for blockchains today (not forever) is number-go-up. The most honest form of number go up is non-utility meme coins.‚Äù The fact that Bitcoin is the world‚Äôs foremost chain also played a role, with Leonidas feeling that ‚Äúthe top blockchain in the world should have the top meme coin in the world.‚Äù\n\nThe Future of Runestones\n\n## The Future of Runestones\n\nCurrently, Runestones remain one of the top collections on marketplaces like Magic Eden. As of this writing, the collection has a market cap of 4,200 BTC (over $292 million) and has generated about over 1,076 BTC in volume on the marketplace.\n\nAs stated above, the Runestone project was developed in anticipation of the upcoming Runes protocol and is intended to ultimately be a part of its ecosystem. According to Leonidas, it‚Äôs not quite a Runes token, but rather a pre-Runes project. The general idea is that no token can truly be part of Runes before the protocol has actually dropped.\n\n‚ÄúThe Runes ecosystem is currently Casey's core protocol, plus companies building explorers, DEXs, [and] wallets to support it, plus pre-Runes projects that plan on releasing Runes tokens when the protocol is released,‚Äù Leonidas explained,[according to Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/219113/bitcoin-ordinals-runestone-airdrop-leonidas-casey-rodarmor-runes).\n\nUnlike many traditional collections, Runestones has no set roadmap. Its creator has described it as a meme coin and said there are no plans to introduce any roadmap for it. Nevertheless, the Ordinals community has rallied behind the project to pay homage to the original supporters of Ordinals, and to prepare for yet another chapter in Bitcoin‚Äôs history.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Exploring the Realm of Dreams Using Bitcoin Ordinals\n\n**Leather: How did you get started in Web3?**\n\n**Buba**: Like many of us who entered in 2021‚Äîby pure chance. I started seeing other artists and friends talking about NFTs and tried my luck. My work seemed to have an audience and I began to have enough financial independence to be able to forget about client commissions and take advantage of the creative freedom that this space offered me to focus on my personal work.\n\n**Leather: What inspired you to create the artworks for ‚ÄòBeyond The Rainbow‚Äô?**\n\n**Buba: ‚Äò**Beyond the Rainbow‚Äô stems from a previous series, ‚ÄòThe Rabbit and the Snake‚Äô, in which I focus on the language that the subconscious uses during dreams to communicate with us. That inner dialogue and the symbols they use inspired me to start.\n\nThen I decided that I had to give a these conversations a place to live on, and so ‚ÄòBeyond the Rainbow‚Äô was born‚Äî the place where all these things happen. With each new work, I expand the lore and mythology of this space. I have the absolute freedom to depict whatever I want, from my deepest obsessions to the latest foolish thing that has occurred to me. Everything has a place here, because ‚ÄòBeyond the Rainbow‚Äô is my home.\n\n**Leather: What impact do you ultimately hope to have with ‚ÄòBeyond the Rainbow‚Äô?**\n\n**Buba**: I don't have a clear long-term goal. Just to create sincere works of art that other people can connect with and enjoy. Works of art that, years from now, can all be put together and tell a common story.\n\nI'm not an ambitious person either‚Äî in a bad way. I've been living from my work as an illustrator for more than a decade. Getting up every morning, dropping my daughters off at school, and going back to the studio to do what I love most in the world is a gift in itself, for which I give thanks every day.\n\n**Leather: What do you hope people take away from your work?**\n\n**Buba**: I would like them to feel identified in some way with the work. I speak of dreams, of the collective unconscious, but also of their own experiences and other universal themes encoded through common symbols. If I can connect with them in that way and make them feel that they are co-protagonists of some of the pieces, I will have achieved my goal.\n\n**Leather: From your perspective, how has the Ordinals art market evolved since its inception or the moment you entered it?**\n\n**Buba**: To be honest, I think I'm the least appropriate person to conduct an analysis of any kind of market. I'm quite focused on my work, which is to create art. Technology still eludes me although I try to learn more every day.\n\nWhat I can say is that an art market is clearly emerging beyond the PFP and that is why many artists began to take an interest in this new space. Everything we have learned on other blockchains, what worked and what could be improved, may have had a lot to do with its rapid development.\n\nWhat has also helped is that a lot of developers have opted to make it easier for people with limited knowledge of this technology. The appearance of specific marketplaces like Gamma and Magic Eden ‚Äì where you can inscribe pieces without having to be a real cypherpunk, as was the case when the protocol was launched ‚Äì is another factor.\n\n**Leather: Where can we find and buy your ‚ÄòBeyond the Rainbow‚Äô Bitcoin Ordinals?**\n\n**Buba**: You can find them both in[Gamma](https://gamma.io/bubaviedma)and in Magic Eden.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Are Taproot Wizards?\n\n[Taproot Wizards](https://taprootwizards.com/collection)is a collection of 2,121 unique wizard-themed Ordinal NFTs inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Currently, about 2,108 Wizards have been inscribed, but the project plans to eventually reach the mark of 2,121 (a nod to Bitcoin‚Äôs maximum supply of 21 million coins).\n\nAll Taproot Wizards feature the hallmark wizard design with a robe, hat, and general facial features. However, these NFTs bear a selection of unique traits, which include:\n\n- **Background:**Wizards can have different colored backgrounds or even unique background elements.\n- **Hat details:**Hats may differ in color, stripes, or adornments.\n- **Facial features:**Some wizards might have beards, mustaches, or different expressions.\n- **Rarities:**Certain rare combinations of traits exist, making some wizards far less common than others.\nHistory of Taproot Wizards\n\n## History of Taproot Wizards\n\nThe Taproot Wizards story began over a decade ago (on 13 February 2013) with the[iconic wizard meme posted on the r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q1sn9/an_interesting_new_ad_on_reddit/)subreddit by user 'mavensbot'.\n\n\"Magic internet money\" ‚Äì well, at least that's what Bitcoin was called in its infancy. Mavensbot‚Äôs depiction of a wizard in a simple Microsoft Paint illustration distilled Bitcoin's promise into a shareable, lighthearted concept.\n\nTen years later, Taproot Wizards was revealed on the same date in 2023. Wizard #0001 closely mirrored the beloved original meme with just a few minor tweaks.\n\nUdi Wertheimer, a prominent developer and crypto advocate who was a member of r/Bitcoin when the original wizard was posted, was one of the project‚Äôs founders. He was inspired by how the 2013 wizard drawing brought new people to Bitcoin and wanted to replicate its original impact. Wertheimer saw the wizard as a symbol that could be leveraged to reinvigorate interest in Bitcoin, especially when Ethereum's NFT successes overshadowed Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum.\n\nTherefore, Wertheimer, along with Eric Wall and FAR, created Taproot Wizards.\n\nThe Goal Behind Taproot Wizards\n\n## The Goal Behind Taproot Wizards\n\nTransactions on the Bitcoin blockchain compete for limited block space, driving up fees. Dedicating such a huge portion to a single inscription dramatically highlighted the trade-off between data types. This shed even more light on Bitcoin‚Äôs age-old block space debate, with some community members supporting the Ordinals movement and some opposing it.\n\nTaproot Wizards was created to highlight Bitcoin's potential use cases beyond peer-to-peer transfers. Udi Wertheimer intentionally inscribed a Taproot Wizard into the largest Bitcoin block ever (at the time), pushing the network's perceived boundaries. The single inscription occupied 3.96 MB of the block's 4 MB.\n\nHow to Acquire a Taproot Wizard\n\n## How to Acquire a Taproot Wizard\n\nThere isn't a clear-cut process for buying a Taproot Wizard. Instead, potential collectors must attend Wizard School. The Wizard School is a playful way to engage their community and create a sense of mystery around acquiring a Taproot Wizard NFT.\n\nThe Wizard School involves joining Taproot Wizards' Discord,[following their X account](https://x.com/taprootwizards), and actively participating in community discussions.\n\nWithin the community, Taproot Wizards might drop hints, puzzles, or quests that, if completed, could lead to the opportunity to obtain a Taproot Wizard inscription. Part of the fun is the element of randomness or luck involved in ultimately being selected to receive a Wizard.\n\nFuture of Taproot Wizards\n\n## Future of Taproot Wizards\n\nTaproot Wizards will likely have a trajectory similar to that of Crypto Punks on Ethereum due to their deep roots within the Bitcoin community's culture. However, the co-founders plan to use Taproot Wizards as the start of something bigger. In line with this vision, they raised[a funding round of $7.5M](https://cryptorank.io/ico/taproot-wizards)to pursue more ambitious development goals and push the limits of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTo continue their mission of innovating on Bitcoin, the Taproot Wizards team also launched Quantum Cats. Quantum Cats uses more complex concepts of Ordinal technology, specifically ‚Äúevolving inscriptions,‚Äù which allow the NFT cats to transform their appearance over time. The collection was originally launched to raise awareness for an old Bitcoin opcode, OP_CAT, which had been abandoned in Bitcoin‚Äôs early years.\n\nNeedless to say, the Taproot Wizards project is still a prominent force in the Bitcoin community. It symbolizes the ecosystem‚Äôs desire to explore what more can be done on Bitcoin, and the barriers that need to be overcome to unlock Bitcoin‚Äôs potential.\n\nnan\n\n",

With your Leather browser extension connected to your preferred NFT marketplace, you will be able to:\n\n- **Mint:**Create new NFTs, bringing your unique digital art and collectibles to life on the blockchain.\n- **Buy:**Discover and acquire a diverse array of NFTs from artists and creators worldwide.\n- **Sell:**Take on the role of a digital art dealer by listing your NFTs for sale.\n- **Trade:**Exchange your NFTs with fellow enthusiasts within the community.\nThis means that Leather provides complete support for Bitcoin NFTs, particularly non-fungible tokens that are part of the Stacks L2 network (Stacks NFTs). If Ordinals are more your style, simply connect your Leather wallet to an Ordinals marketplace like Gamma and explore a vast collection of generative art pieces, including high-end collections like[TwelveFold](https://gamma.io/ordinals/collections/twelvefold).\n\nNeedless to say, the Bitcoin NFT landscape is expanding. Here are the particular standards and protocols that Leather users should be familiar with as they explore the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem with their wallet.\n\nDeep Dive into Bitcoin NFT Standards and Protocols\n\n## Deep Dive into Bitcoin NFT Standards and Protocols\n\nFrom the foundational layers that brought NFTs to Bitcoin to the latest innovations expanding what's possible, here are protocols that Leather users can engage with to maximize their Bitcoin NFT experience.\n\n### Stacks NFTs: Elevating Bitcoin with Smart Contracts\n\nBefore the Ordinals buzz in 2023, Stacks was already revolutionizing the Bitcoin NFT space. Leather was the first wallet to offer comprehensive support for Stacks NFTs through its user-friendly browser extension.\n\nThis extension not only facilitates a seamless connection to various Stacks NFT marketplaces but also empowers you to engage in the full spectrum of NFT activities: minting, buying, selling, and trading‚Äîall on the Stacks Bitcoin layer.\n\nSIP-009 is the token standard for these NFTs. It leverages Stacks as a Layer 2 on Bitcoin, introducing smart contracts and off-chain data storage for enhanced flexibility and creativity.\n\n### Ordinals: Expanding Your Bitcoin NFT Horizons\n\n[Ordinals](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals)have become central to the Bitcoin NFT narrative and with their Leather wallet, users can connect to any of the marketplaces that offer Ordinals including Gamma and[Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/), among others.\n\nBy connecting your Leather wallet to an Ordinals marketplace, you will be able to mint, buy, sell, and trade these precious digital artifacts inscribed directly on Bitcoin.\n\nBut there's more to Leather than just transactions: it also serves as a safe home for your inscriptions, the digital artifacts by inscribing metadata onto satoshis. Leather users can view their Ordinals in the ‚ÄúCollectibles‚Äù section of their wallet extension, which also serves as a hub for users to send and receive Ordinal NFTs. Essentially, users are able to participate in the entire life cycle of an Ordinal and transact among users directly from their wallet.\n\n### Bitcoin Stamps: Securing Art on the Blockchain\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Ordinals, Bitcoin Stamps, or STAMPS (Bitcoin Secure Tradeable Art Managed Securely), elevate the concept of permanence on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nKnown in the technical realm as SRC-20 tokens, the STAMPS protocol ingeniously prevents the pruning of data by anchoring images to spendable transaction outputs on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring their longevity and immutability. These SRC-20 tokens transform into collectibles that find a home right inside your Leather wallet.\n\nVenturing into STAMPS marketplaces, such as[Rare Stamp](https://www.rarestamp.xyz/0), becomes a breeze with your Leather wallet, allowing you to mint and acquire these unique pieces. Once obtained, they seamlessly integrate into your Leather's ‚ÄúCollectibles‚Äù section and are showcased as part of your digital gems.\n\nUnlocking Bitcoin NFTs with Leather\n\n## Unlocking Bitcoin NFTs with Leather\n\nLeather is your entry point to discover Web3 built on Bitcoin. In this case, your Leather wallet makes the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem accessible and engaging, whether you're taking your first steps or are already a seasoned degen.\n\nLeather's mission aligns with the broader vision of advancing the Bitcoin economy, offering a platform not just for secure transactions but for immersive exploration of the Bitcoin Web3 landscape. You're equipped with the tools to navigate, participate, and innovate within the digital economy, ensuring you're at the forefront of the NFT movement.\n\nFor those ready to dive deep into the evolving world of Bitcoin NFTs, Leather stands as your reliable companion, unlocking the full potential of your digital assets.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## The Growth and Evolution of the Ordinals Art Market\n\nThe Ordinals protocol has catalyzed a significant transformation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is now a burgeoning canvas for digital artists and collectors, and the rapid development of inscription-focused technology has given the[Bitcoin NFT](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-nfts)ecosystem a boost. As a result, Bitcoin NFTs are[projected to reach a market cap of $4.5 billion by 2025](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/bitcoin-ordinals-inscriptions-5-billion-nft-market/).\n\nThis growth signals a deliberate expansion of Bitcoin's utility. It also represents the enthusiasm of users who are embracing art through Ordinals.\n\nThe appeal of the Ordinals art market lies not only in its novelty but also in the seamless integration of art with Bitcoin's core principles‚Äîimmutability, security, and a decentralized ledger that stands the test of time. These features make Bitcoin an ideal medium for hosting culturally and historically significant artifacts, elevating digital art to new levels of significance and value.\n\nThe rapid evolution of Ordinals is a testament to the adaptability and creativity of the digital art community. Artists from other decentralized ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, or Tezos are now venturing into Bitcoin, armed with a wealth of experience and lessons learned.\n\n[Nick Sainato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-sainato), co-founder of[Gamma](https://gamma.io/), one of Bitcoin Ordinals top marketplaces, sees a maturing market that's increasingly attracting top talent and fostering creative innovation. This maturity is evidenced by the thoughtful curation and onboarding of artists, which Gamma and similar platforms facilitate through initiatives like the Partner Curators within the Gamma Partner Program. These efforts underscore the community's commitment to advancing art on Bitcoin, building a rich, diverse ecosystem that thrives on collaboration and mutual growth.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen more and more platforms enter the space and show interest in thoughtful curation and onboarding of top talent,‚Äù said Sainato. ‚ÄúAs more artists become comfortable with the medium and its limitations and affordances, it opens the door for significantly more creative innovation on Bitcoin as a canvas.‚Äù\n\nWhile the early growth of Ordinals has been linked to speculation, as is typical in many new markets, Sainato believes speculation isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. ‚ÄúIt exposes the use cases where there is a clear product market fit. Art is one such use case where there is a perfect fit,‚Äù he mentioned.\n\nFor Sainato and for many others in the space, ‚Äúthere are few things better suited to the permanence, durability, and censorship resistance of Bitcoin than culturally and historically significant artifacts like art‚Äù.\n\nOvercoming the Challenges of Entering a Nascent Ecosystem\n\n## Overcoming the Challenges of Entering a Nascent Ecosystem\n\nThe transition to Ordinals, however, can be challenging. High-end artists and collectors face the complexities of navigating a nascent ecosystem, striving to balance the excitement of innovation with the practicalities of security, display, and transactional ease.\n\nThe technical barriers and cost associated with inscribing large, high-resolution pieces onto the Bitcoin blockchain have proven to be significant hurdles, mirroring the experience of many artists during the 2021 NFT boom on Ethereum. For instance,[Empress Trash](https://twitter.com/EmpressTrash), a digital artist who became one of Gamma‚Äôs partner artists in February 2024, had been following the Ordinals market since its inception, but technical challenges kept her from participating in the market at the time.\n\nIt was only when Gamma approached her at the end of 2023 that Empress became excited about an art-focused platform on Bitcoin. She loved how easy it was to mint inscriptions on their platform and decided to join Gamma almost a year later.\n\nFor Empress, the ecosystem‚Äôs rapid growth is partly due to the fact that ‚ÄúBTC has a lot of resources in general because of how much money flows and dominates the crypto market.‚Äù But also, she noticed that even though it sometimes moves at a slower pace than other communities, ‚Äúthe leaders in [the ecosystem] seem more thoughtful and deliberate in moves for the culture and ethos.‚Äù\n\nBut there is another limitation: high transaction fees. When inscribing Ordinals, the larger the image size, the higher the cost.[Inscribing a simple 20kb image](https://blog.ordinalhub.com/how-to-calculate-the-cost-to-create-an-inscription/)can cost as much as 435,000 sats. This is a big hurdle for creators who work with high resolution mediums or even video, leading artists like Buba Viedma to highlight the additional challenges Ordinals can bring.\n\n‚ÄúThat's why for some fine art artists, it can still be a risky bet to register an Ordinal for hundreds or even thousands of dollars if they are doing well in other blockchains,‚Äù he emphasized. Not only that, but it could also mean that ‚Äúthe prices of the pieces have to increase to recover that initial investment, which also leaves out some collectors.‚Äù\n\nEmpress Trash initially also felt discouraged to enter the space due to high fees. ‚ÄúIt felt like a big risk inscribing and spending $200+ dollars and not knowing if anyone would care about my work or buy it,‚Äù she noted.\n\nHowever, Gamma‚Äôs fresh take on editions ‚Äî or ‚Äúprints‚Äù as they're known ‚Äî enables partner artists to create low-cost, recursive editions from a single high-resolution original. This approach feels much less risky to artists like Empress because, like many other creators entering a new market, they sell a number of editions at a lower price to build their reputation and a collector base before raising prices on their work.\n\nDespite these obstacles, the allure of the Ordinals ecosystem lies with its promise of permanence and the opportunity to be part of a growing movement that redefines the boundaries of digital art.\n\nThe Artist's Journey into Ordinals\n\n## The Artist's Journey into Ordinals\n\nThe migration of artists into the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem is bringing much needed diversity and richness. Many experienced artists like Empress Trash, who have previously navigated other NFT markets, are now exploring the untapped potential of Bitcoin as a new medium for their digital creations.\n\n[Buba Viedma's entry into the Ordinals space](https://leather.io/blog/bringing-the-language-of-dreams-into-bitcoin-ordinals-with-buba-viedma)was facilitated by a project that sought to bridge the gap between Ethereum artists and the Bitcoin ecosystem. As a seasoned artist in other NFT ecosystems, this collaboration highlights the inclusive and expansive nature of the Ordinals community. Artists are no longer confined to a single blockchain or platform; instead, they are beginning to see the digital art landscape as a vast, interconnected ecosystem where different blockchains offer unique benefits and opportunities for creative expression.\n\nBuba's reflections on his experience underscore a critical aspect of the artist's journey into Ordinals: the importance of simplicity and accessibility. For the Ordinals art market to flourish, platforms and wallets must prioritize ease of use, ensuring that artists and collectors alike can navigate the ecosystem without being hindered by technical complexities. Wallets like Leather and marketplaces like Gamma play a pivotal role in giving artists and collectors the necessary tools and environment to thrive in this new digital renaissance.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of developers have opted to make it easier for people with limited knowledge of this technology,‚Äù said Viedma. He feels encouraged by ‚Äúthe appearance of specific marketplaces such as Gamma or Magic Eden, from where you can inscribe the pieces without having to be a real cypherpunk, as was the case when the protocol was launched.‚Äù\n\nThe experience of artists like Buba Viedma and Empress Trash offer valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of the digital art market. Their journeys demonstrate the need for platforms and wallets to be fully accessible and support artistic innovation.\n\nOrdinals Community Role in Bridging Gaps\n\n## Ordinals Community Role in Bridging Gaps\n\nUltimately, the maturity and future of the Ordinals art market will hinge on the community's collective efforts to overcome technical hurdles, reduce costs, and enhance accessibility.\n\n‚ÄúFrom a wallet perspective, things like hardware wallet support will become increasingly important,‚Äù said Sainato. ‚ÄúCollectors need to know that their investment in high value pieces isn‚Äôt exposed to unnecessary risk, and these integrations take a big step in the right direction.‚Äù Sainato also believes that ‚Äúsupport for various display types, including generative works and recursive inscriptions is also going to become increasingly important, as these types of art pieces are well suited to high fee environments.‚Äù\n\nLeather is at the forefront of addressing these challenges. By developing features tailored to the needs of the Ordinals art market, Leather can provide a safe and user-friendly environment for artists and collectors. This not only supports the current market but also paves the way for future growth and innovation, ensuring that the Ordinals ecosystem continues to thrive.\n\nIt is clear that the emergence of high-end art on Bitcoin is not just another speculative crypto market‚Äîit‚Äôs a significant evolution marking a new chapter in the digital art narrative.\n\nAnd now is the time to access it with Leather: your most accessible, secure, private and dedicated Bitcoin and Ordinals wallet ready for the present and the future of the thriving Ordinals art market.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is Quantum Cats?\n\n[Quantum Cats](https://www.quantumcats.xyz/)is an Ordinals collection that consists of[3,333 pieces](https://www.quantumcats.xyz/collection). The collection was announced on[January 12](https://x.com/QuantumCatsXYZ/status/1745824349293092904?s=20)via the project‚Äôs official X page and has attracted considerable interest for its goal of promoting awareness for OP_CAT.\n\nThe ‚ÄúGenesis Cat‚Äù auction marked a special milestone for the collection. This unique piece, created by digital artist[FAR](https://twitter.com/0xfar), stood out as the sole 1/1 in the series. It was auctioned at Sotheby‚Äôs on January 22 for[$254,000](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/29/taproot-wizards-debut-sale-of-bitcoin-nfts-quantum-cats-marred-by-tech-issues/#:~:text=The%20first%20item%20in%20the,for%20an%20eye%2Dpopping%20%24254%2C000.), underscoring its exclusivity. It has remained one of the most successful collection launches in the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem, raising over $13 million.\n\nHistory of Quantum Cats\n\n## History of Quantum Cats\n\nUdi Wertheimer, Eric Wall, and FAR founded Taproot Wizards to drive innovation on the Bitcoin network. As pioneers in exploring the potential of Ordinals, they launched the Taproot Wizards collection as a free mint, marking their initial success. Following this, the team introduced Quantum Cats.\n\nThe primary goal of Quantum Cats is to advocate for and support OP_CAT. OP_CAT is a proposed opcode that would significantly improve Bitcoin's scripting capabilities, enabling more complex applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWertheimer and Wall have consistently expressed their belief in the necessity of innovation within Bitcoin's ecosystem. As such, they wanted to revive discussions around the implementation of OP_CAT, which would possibly be a key advancement for Bitcoin.\n\nQuantum Cats Concept\n\n## Quantum Cats Concept\n\nQuantum Cats was designed using the[recursive inscription](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-recursive-inscriptions)technique, which allows each cat to change over time. The collection used 10MB of on-chain data, surpassing the typical 1MB Bitcoin block capacity. This encryption ensures that the future evolutions of these digital cats remain a mystery until their predetermined unveiling, adding an element of anticipation and surprise.\n\nAs we mentioned, Quantum Cats is designed to bring awareness to OP_CAT. OP_CAT is a depreciated opcode (operational code) that was originally a core part of Bitcoin's scripting language written by Satoshi. This opcode allowed for the concatenation (joining) of two strings of data end to end within Bitcoin's scripts.\n\nOP_CAT was removed in 2010 due to security concerns. For example, OP_CAT could be used to create excessively large or complex transactions. In turn, this could potentially subject the Bitcoin ecosystem to issues like denial-of-service attacks. The implementation of Taproot, however, has led many to believe that the original concerns with OP_CAT have been addressed.\n\nThe creators of Quantum Cats and the collection's community members believe that OP_CAT would enable additional[use cases](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitstream-white-paper-proposes-bitcoin-payments-to-disrupt-file-storage-economy/)as originally intended and, if implemented, the opcode could bring more functionality back to Bitcoin. OP_CAT essentially enables data concatenation within scripts. This would potentially help power transactions that can integrate multiple conditions, signatures, and data points within a single transaction. This capability could drastically expand the types of transactions that are feasible on the Bitcoin network, from complex multi-signature wallets to on-chain multi-party agreements.\n\nUltimately, the integration of OP_CAT could significantly drive more innovation on Bitcoin's and enhance scalability and security. Its implementation, however, would involve a ten-line code change and require a soft fork of Bitcoin itself. For this to happen, community consensus would be needed for its activation on Bitcoin, and it is one of the crucial steps outlined in Quantum Cats‚Äô Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)[land map](https://www.quantumcats.xyz/bip-land).\n\nThe Future of Quantum Cats\n\n## The Future of Quantum Cats\n\nIt is too early to tell what Quantum Cats could potentially be or even how the Cats will evolve. Nonetheless, Quantum Cats is a symbol for change and will pave the way for more innovative projects and improvements on Bitcoin.\n\nThe collection‚Äôs popularity speaks to the wider Bitcoin community‚Äôs enthusiasm to bring more use cases to the world‚Äôs oldest blockchain just as much as it represents their desire for[high-end Ordinals](https://leather.io/blog/the-rise-of-the-high-end-bitcoin-ordinals-market). To join this community, Leather users can purchase Quantum Cats on platforms like Magic Eden by simply connecting their wallet.\n\nAfter all, holding a Quantum Cat means that users are, in some way, participating in yet another key chapter of Bitcoin‚Äôs history.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Are Bitcoin Halving Events?\n\nIn short, a Bitcoin halving is an event in which the amount of BTC that Bitcoin miners receive as a reward for their work gets cut in half. But in order to properly understand the process and the potential impact of halvings, you need to know a little about how Bitcoin mining works.\n\nMining is an integral part of the Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs functionality. It‚Äôs a process by which a network of validators use computers and mining hardware to vet and process transactions. When a block of transactions is full, it‚Äôs sent to a queue where miners verify the legitimacy of the transactions. At the current rate, miners are paid 6.25 BTC when they verify a block and it is added to the blockchain. The payment is an incentive for them to do the work of validating, recognizing that miners‚Äô roles are integral in keeping transactions smooth and secure.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs code states that after every 210,000 blocks are created, the mining reward will be cut in half. Given that blocks are added around every 10 minutes, these halving events occur roughly every four years. The most recent instance was in May 2020; but since these events are based on block finalization ‚Äì and not a calendar ‚Äì we don‚Äôt know precisely when the next halving will occur. This next imminent halving is estimated to occur on April 20.\n\nWhy Halvings are Significant for the Bitcoin Blockchain\n\n## Why Halvings are Significant for the Bitcoin Blockchain\n\nOne of the reasons that these events are so important to Bitcoin is its immutability. There is a fixed number of BTC available ‚Äì 21 million of them. And of that total, more than 19 million of them have been mined to date. Many believe that over time, the increased scarcity of new coins will impact prices in a bullish way.\n\nThe initial reward for miners was 50 BTC, but it‚Äôs been halved three times since its inception. First to 25 BTC in 2012, followed by down to 12.5 BTC in 2016 and then to 6.25 BTC during the last halving. These cuts help to decrease the number of new bitcoins introduced as well as to keep inflation low, but it also increases the costs for any given miner to break even on their work. This upcoming Bitcoin halving event is set to reduce block rewards to 3.125 BTC when it occurs.\n\nThe halving policy was written into Bitcoin‚Äôs algorithm to help maintain scarcity levels, which makes it a semi-permanent fixture of the protocol. Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin‚Äôs supply policy and monetary rules are fixed. To make a broad change to any part of the underlying code would require a significant, concerted effort that the Bitcoin community at-large would need to agree to. The ‚Äúbaked-in‚Äù status of this process is why it‚Äôs important for users to understand the impact a halving has on BTC.\n\nHow The Bitcoin Halving Will Impact Users\n\n## How The Bitcoin Halving Will Impact Users\n\nTechnically, a halving event itself doesn‚Äôt change anything for users who are just looking to conduct transactions. But there could be ripple-effects that users should be aware of. There‚Äôs no way to know how the markets will respond to the next halving, but previous instances have seen some price volatility both in the leadup and aftermath.\n\nBut another much-discussed potential impact has to do with block rewards. These rewards are an important part of Bitcoin‚Äôs security infrastructure. As they decrease, the potential exists for lowered security.\n\nThis is because block rewards are the main way that miners make their money. When they are reduced, the miners‚Äô reliance on profit from[transaction fees](https://leather.io/learn/how-do-transaction-fees-work-on-bitcoin)increases, opening up the possibility that miners may shift processing power away from BTC in order to earn more elsewhere.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt just slow down transactions for users; it could also weaken the system. Generally speaking, the more computing power that‚Äôs being directed toward the Bitcoin network, the more difficult it would be to attack. Any bad actors would need to have a similar amount of processing power in order to make moves against the network.\n\nNow, none of this is a certainty. It is equally easy to make an argument for miners to stick around. Today's existing demand ‚Äì which has surged thanks to a number of recent developments on Bitcoin ‚Äì has continued to drive up transaction fees as the network experiences more traffic. Especially as subsequent halving events further reduce block rewards, this could incentivize miners to continue their work.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin halving events have also served as a catalyst for infrastructure upgrades and hardware improvements that have focused on making mining more efficient. This ultimately benefits the Bitcoin mining community and, by extension, the Bitcoin ecosystem in the long run.\n\nConclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe predictable nature of Bitcoin halvings helps to avoid any shocks to the system, but the upcoming event will still be important to follow for crypto enthusiasts. As block rewards are cut again for miners, the importance of protocol growth and mass adoption is thrown further into the spotlight.\n\nThis, ultimately, makes Bitcoin halving events important for users to watch. The advent of Ordinals,[BRC-20 tokens](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-the-brc-20-token-standard), Runes, and other developments have brought more users than ever before to Bitcoin. As we look to future developments on Bitcoin, staying informed about halving events will be essential for any crypto user.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "bitcoin-runes-have-come-to-leather-unpacking-the-runes-protocol",
    "Body": "## What Are Runes?\n\n[Runes](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-runes)is a fungible token protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain that follows the Bitcoin-native Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. UTXO is the number of unspent tokens that remain after a successful transaction and can be used in subsequent transactions.\n\nIn September 2023, Casey Rodarmor, the founder of Bitcoin Ordinals, pitched Runes in a[blog post](https://rodarmor.com/blog/runes/)to further the development of Bitcoin-based fungible tokens.\n\nRunes is not the first fungible protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain. Several other token standards and protocols, like BRC-20 and Taproot Assets, also offer fungible token support for Bitcoin. However, Runes offers a better system for fungible tokens compared to existing Bitcoin protocols by reducing network congestion and dependence on off-chain data.\n\nThe protocol launched in conjunction with the fourth Bitcoin halving when Bitcoin reached a block height of 840,000.\n\nSo how, exactly, do Runes work? First, it‚Äôs necessary to understand the shortcomings of other fungible token protocols.\n\nThe Problems Of Existing Bitcoin-Based Fungible Token Protocols\n\n## The Problems Of Existing Bitcoin-Based Fungible Token Protocols\n\nGenerally, existing Bitcoin-based fungible protocols often have issues related to UTXO management, which creates ‚Äújunk‚Äù UTXOs that clog the network and lead to a spike in transaction fees. For example, the prominent BRC-20 token standard (which utilizes the Ordinals protocol) has been known to flood the network with redundant UTXOs. In May 2023, Bitcoin transaction fees[surged by 800%](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/bitcoins-brc-20-explosion-sends-users-scrambling-for-options-including-lightning/)due to an overwhelming number of BRC-20 transactions.\n\nMoreover, some Bitcoin fungible protocols store data off-chain and require an off-chain indexer to determine a wallet‚Äôs fungible token balance. For example, RGB (Really Good For Bitcoin) and Taproot Assets rely on off-chain data and have complicated technical infrastructures.\n\nOff-chain data is problematic because it lies beyond a blockchain‚Äôs security mechanism and fails to guarantee data integrity. Taproot Assets store data in local data stores or information repositories called ‚ÄòUniverses‚Äô. To check asset validity, one has to verify transaction data from the genesis output through Taproot‚Äôs gossip layer, making it a complex process.\n\nOn the other hand, the Runes protocol leverages the UTXO system.\n\nHow Does the Runes Protocol Work?\n\n## How Does the Runes Protocol Work?\n\nWithin the Runes protocol, UTXOs hold the Rune balances, and each UTXO can hold any number of Runes. The subsequent transactions use the balance from the UTXO database which removes ‚Äújunk‚Äù UTXOs from the network. Since UTXOs track the Runes' tokens balance, the protocol doesn‚Äôt require any off-chain indexer.\n\nA new Runes transaction begins with token issuance (‚Äúetching‚Äù) that determines properties like the total supply and token symbol, and allocates it to a UTXO. The transfer function uses the UTXO and updates transaction details after successful token transfers to recipient addresses.\n\nEach issuance transaction can create up to 2^128-1 of the issued Rune. The Runes symbol has a base 26-encoded human-readable symbol, with characters from A to Z. Moreover, the Runes protocol would avoid ‚Äòsymbol squatting‚Äô to encourage ‚Äòcompetition for desirable symbols‚Äô such as shorter tickers, memorable names etc.\n\nThere are three main actions that users can take with Runes:\n\n### Etch\n\nDuring the etching process, a Runes token‚Äôs creator determines its basic properties, such as:\n\n- Token name\n- Token divisibility\n- Unicode-based symbol\n- Amount of the token that can be minted at once\n- Total supply\nBased on the block and order in which the etching occurs, the Runes protocol assigns that etching with a unique ID.\n\n### Mint\n\nAfter a token has been etched, users will be able to mint the token. However, they will only be able to mint a certain number of Runes during the transaction, depending on the properties that were set during a token‚Äôs etching.\n\n### Transfer\n\nTo transfer Runes to a recipient, a user needs to create one or multiple edicts. Edicts contain the Rune token ID, the amount you wish to transfer, and the Runes‚Äô output number.\n\nBecause multiple edicts can be included in one transfer, this means that a user can send Runes to multiple recipients in one transaction.\n\nProjects Inspired By The Runes Protocol\n\n## Projects Inspired By The Runes Protocol\n\nWhen Rodarmor announced Runes, it led to many Runes-inspired Ordinals projects that planned to airdrop Rune tokens. These collections played a significant role in drumming up excitement for the protocol prior to its mainnet launch.\n\nSome of the top pre-Runes Ordinals projects are:\n\n- Runestone\n- Rune Guardians\n- Rune Pups\n- [Bitcoin Burials](https://leather.io/blog/celebrating-bitcoin-s-resilience-with-bitcoin-burials)\n- Runecoin\n- Ape Odyssey\n- Runevo\n- Game of Blocks\n- Tiny Vikings\n- Runepunks\n- XO Unchained\nThe Impact Of Runes On The Bitcoin Ecosystem\n\n## The Impact Of Runes On The Bitcoin Ecosystem\n\nCreating a well-built Bitcoin-based fungible token protocol is necessary to bring new users, good developers, and more revenue to Bitcoin. And that‚Äôs what the Runes protocol wants to do for the Bitcoin community.\n\nRunes runs on the Bitcoin-native UTXO model and doesn‚Äôt rely on off-chain data or require a native token. Thus, the Runes protocol might encourage users from other networks to shift to Bitcoin.\n\nKeep in mind, since all of these developments are pretty experimental, you‚Äôll need a Bitcoin wallet that shields you from any potential security concerns. Leather allows you to interact with the Rune tokens while keeping you safe at every stage of your journey.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is Bitcoin Finality?\n\nBitcoin finality refers to the stage at which transactions on the blockchain become irreversible. To change transaction history after finality, you‚Äôd need enormous computational power, which is economically unviable.\n\nFor example, in a 51% attack, miners gain control of more than 50% of the network‚Äôs mining hash rate and can tamper the transaction history. During a bear market in June 2023, an attacker still would have required[$7.9 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp)and additional infrastructure to execute such an attack.\n\nThe initial Stacks design encountered several obstacles such as slow block confirmation times. These infrastructural challenges prevented the L2 network from achieving complete Bitcoin finality. However, the Nakamoto upgrade will offer Stacks 100% Bitcoin finality and Stacks will be able to leverage the complete security benefits of the Bitcoin network.\n\nChallenges with Stacks‚Äô Initial Design\n\n## Challenges with Stacks‚Äô Initial Design\n\nOver the past three years, the Stacks ecosystem has encountered several operational challenges. These challenges revolve around block production, microblock usage, orphaning or removing transactions and miners, and cheap reorganizations.\n\n### Slow block times\n\nOriginally, the Stacks block production rate was tied to Bitcoin block production in a 1:1 ratio. It takes approximately 10 minutes to produce a Bitcoin block and thus, all Stacks transactions have the same transaction confirmation time. A high confirmation time leads to network latency and slows down Stacks applications.\n\n### Ineffective microblocks\n\nMicroblocks are a legacy feature of the previous version of Stacks. They received unconfirmed transactions from the mempool and validated them before writing to the Bitcoin blockchain. Although microblocks were originally created to improve Stacks transaction throughput, the protocol could not ensure proper transaction storage in the microblocks. Essentially, there was no consensus procedure to start building from the latest microblock and new miners could remove recently confirmed transactions in the microblocks.\n\n### Cheaper block reorganization\n\nBlockchain reorganization, popularly known as reorgs, occurs when validators disagree on the accuracy of a chain and remove existing blocks. Reorgs lead to delayed transaction confirmation, and high node costs, and the blockchain becomes more vulnerable to attacks.\n\nIt is cheaper to reorganize the last N blocks in the Stacks chain compared to the Bitcoin network. Thus, malicious miners can reorganize the Stacks chain history and alter transaction history.\n\nHow Will Nakamoto Achieve 100% Bitcoin Finality?\n\n## How Will Nakamoto Achieve 100% Bitcoin Finality?\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade will introduce three fundamental changes to the Stacks network that will reduce block production time to roughly 5 seconds.\n\n### Tenure-based block production\n\nThe new update decouples Stacks and Bitcoin‚Äôs block production through a tenure-based block production mechanism.\n\nEach Bitcoin block begins a new tenure with a cryptographic sortition procedure. This process uses cryptography for selecting a new miner to validate transactions and create new blocks.\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade enables a single miner to mine several Stacks blocks instead of just one block within the tenure.\n\nTo ensure the validity of Stacks block production, Stackers approve each miner's block during their tenure. Moreover, Stackers agree on the last signed block so that the next miner can start building from that block after a tenure change. Such a method also prevents Stacks forks.\n\nStackers and miners work together to increase transaction speeds and create blocks faster. During each new Bitcoin block, Stacks references the first Stacks block in the previous tenure, thereby ensuring network consistency. This also helps in easy transaction data synchronization between the two chains.\n\n### Block finality through indexed block hash\n\nWith the Nakamoto upgrade, Stacks writes transaction data to the Bitcoin chain using an indexed block hash. The indexed block hash is the first block hash that the previous Stacks miner mined during their tenure.\n\nDuring the block commit transaction, miners will add the indexed block hash to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe indexed hash offers Bitcoin finality by resolving miner connectivity issues and provides nodes with updated Stacks chain state copies. Thus, Stackers can prevent Stacks forks and easily identify and recover Stacks transactions affected by Bitcoin reorgs.\n\nAt every Bitcoin block N+1, the Stacks chain state is already written to the Bitcoin network till the start of tenure N. So even if malicious actors gain access to Stackers‚Äôs signing keys, they cannot rewrite Stacks history without rewriting Bitcoin history.\n\n### MEV reduction\n\nMiner Extractable Value (MEV) is a common problem on the Bitcoin blockchain. Essentially, miners can manipulate transaction ordering for more profits. In pre-Nakamoto Stacks, some Bitcoin miners could censor transactions of other Stacks miners to unfairly win block rewards.\n\nHowever, the Nakamoto upgrade uses a variation of the Assumed Total Commitment With Carryforward (ATC-C) MEV mitigation strategy. The upgrade has also introduced other measures for fair Stacks mining.\n\nFor instance, miners must consistently participate in the last ten blocks to qualify for the cryptographic sortition process. Moreover, Stacks reduces extreme bidding behavior by calculating the miner‚Äôs winning probability through a median total BTC bid of the last ten blocks. It also includes an absolute bid total for a robust mining environment.\n\nThese methods safeguard Stacks against manipulation and reward genuine miners who contribute to the network‚Äôs security.\n\nThe Importance of Immediate Finality In The Bitcoin Ecosystem\n\n## The Importance of Immediate Finality In The Bitcoin Ecosystem\n\nLayer-2 networks like Stacks are crucial for tapping into the value of BTC assets through apps within the Bitcoin economy. These apps must rely on the Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs security to offer maximum protection to users. However, in doing so, apps shouldn‚Äôt compromise on speed and efficiency.\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade ensures enhanced transaction settlement speed and facilitates users' use of Stacks for everyday purposes. By guaranteeing 100% Bitcoin finality, Stacks will unlock a potentially booming DeFi economy with BTC-based payment systems, exchanges, and more.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Title": "A Bitcoin User's Guide to Mempool Sniping",
    "Slug": "a-bitcoin-user-s-guide-to-mempool-sniping",
    "Body": "## What Is the Mempool?\n\nThe mempool is essentially a waiting room for Bitcoin transactions that have been verified by available node operators on the network, but have not been confirmed by miners through the proof of work (PoW) algorithm and imprinted on the blockchain.\n\nAs we know, [miners don‚Äôt work for free](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-halving). They allocate resources toward transactions that give them the chance to earn the maximum extractable value (MEV), meaning that a transaction with higher associated fees will be processed more quickly than a transaction with lower fees as miners compete for their block reward.\n\nThis often results in smaller transactions being stuck in the mempool waiting room for quite some time. Even though Bitcoin‚Äôs block time is around 10 minutes on average, small transactions can end up there for 72 hours when the network is particularly congested, at which point the transaction will be canceled and funds are returned to the transacting parties‚Äô wallets.\n\nThe process works very similarly when it comes to Ordinals-based transactions. A user signs an off-chain partially signed Bitcoin transaction (PSBT) swap, which is held by a marketplace until the other party also signs, at which time the transaction is sent to the mempool.\n\nWhile funds are never lost because of this mode of operation, the way the mempool functions in practice does pose potential risks to time-sensitive transactions.\n\nIn the Crosshairs\n\n## In the Crosshairs\n\nWhile mempool sniping can technically occur with any type of transaction, we‚Äôll primarily focus on Ordinals marketplaces as they have seen the largest increase in mempool sniping as of late.\n\nPSBTs are party-agnostic tools. Any counterparty can complete the PSBT once sent to the mempool as long as a given amount of Bitcoin is sent to the original party‚Äôs account. Even after it is signed by the original counterparty, any other user can retrieve PSBT information from the mempool, sign it themselves while also assigning a larger fee, and then send it back to the mempool knowing their version will be confirmed more quickly than the original.\n\nThey have just ‚Äòsniped‚Äô the transaction.\n\nAs we mentioned, there has been more attention paid to mempool sniping of late as users vie for coveted Bitcoin Ordinals collections. For example, in one case a sniper was able to[snipe another user‚Äôs Quantum Cat purchase](https://twitter.com/punk9059/status/1769496410917834985)for an extra $180 in transaction fees. The Ordinal NFT was later listed for a handsome price of 1.9 BTC.\n\nFinding Cover\n\n## Finding Cover\n\nFalling victim to mempool sniping isn‚Äôt fun. But mempool sniping likely isn't going away.\n\nJust last month, a Bitcoin block on the Binance network[raked in](https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000009b72e3105db9e641c69780a5a7debd552f31ec2f92dd)one third of its associated fees from only a few sniped transactions. The practice is fruitful for miners and is continuing to prove useful for users who are confident that deploying a small amount of capital on increasing a transaction fee will net them an even larger post-snipe profit.\n\nFortunately, many members of the Bitcoin community are aware that this is something that can have an outsized effect on marketplaces if left unchecked, potentially damaging user trust and driving newer community members away.\n\nDue to the completely transparent nature of the Bitcoin blockchain and Ordinals tools, it‚Äôs not possible for users to hide transactions in the mempool. Bitcoin is a public ledger and this decentralized transparency is fundamental to the network‚Äôs security and immutability.\n\nGenerally, users might need to spend a little bit of extra time monitoring the mempool to track their transactions. Though this is, technically, a sure-fire way for users to make sure that their specific transactions are not sniped, it is cumbersome and time-consuming. Fortunately, a number of developers are already building solutions to help protect users.\n\n[Magisat](http://magisat.io/)has developed a mempool marketplace, which gives users direct access to pending PSBTs. It tracks every single Ordinals transaction and makes it available for bidding up until the exact moment the transaction is confirmed by the network‚Äôs miners. This solution takes away any advantage other than capital for prospective mempool snipers, drastically re-leveling the playing field for users who aren‚Äôt veterans of mempool navigation and tracking transactions through blocks.\n\nFor their part,[MagicEden](http://magiceden.io/)has announced that it will attempt to implement on-demand transaction signing. While this isn‚Äôt a perfect solution in its own right, it would provide more security through higher up-front fees that should help push transactions across the mempool finish line.\n\nEducating Users About Bitcoin Transactions\n\n## Educating Users About Bitcoin Transactions\n\nMempool sniping is a reality that users will have to contend with. As the Bitcoin collectibles market and user base grows, certain users will continue to push every advantage at their disposal to secure assets.\n\nFortunately, marketplaces and builders in the Bitcoin community are keenly aware of the practice and are taking steps to ensure fairness and transparency. Projects are already emerging to help users mitigate experiences that could hinder their Bitcoin network transactions. As more crypto users explore the Bitcoin ecosystem thanks to Ordinals and new developments on the blockchain, it‚Äôs important for them to understand how Bitcoin transactions work and how they can protect themselves while navigating the network.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "how-the-stacks-nakamoto-release-will-contribute-to-bitcoin-security",
    "Body": "## What is the Nakamoto Upgrade?\n\n[Nakamoto](https://www.nakamoto.run/)aims to make the Stacks network as secure as the Bitcoin network by integrating concepts like 100% Bitcoin finality into block production. The ecosystem‚Äôs goal with Nakamoto is to leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs security while achieving transaction speeds comparable to those of newer blockchains.\n\nA key step to achieving this is to decouple Stacks block production from Bitcoin block production.\n\n[Bitcoin finality](https://leather.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin-finality-achieving-100-bitcoin-finality-with-stacks)is a core part of Nakamoto. The term refers to an important point where reversing a Stacks transaction becomes as difficult as reversing a Bitcoin transaction. Establishing finality is paramount because it guarantees the immutability and reliability of transactions ‚Äî core principles of blockchain technology.\n\nStacks Nakamoto and Bitcoin Security\n\n## Stacks Nakamoto and Bitcoin Security\n\nStacks is built on Bitcoin and with Bitcoin finality, security dynamics are reinforced. Transactions on the Stacks network are as secure and irreversible as those on the Bitcoin network, but Nakamoto would fundamentally change a lot of how the Stacks blockchain ‚Äì including how it secures transactions ‚Äì works.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at the top five concepts Nakamoto will introduce and how they could affect the security of transactions on the Stacks blockchain.\n\n### Miner tenure\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade introduces a significant change with the concept of miner tenure. Traditionally, Stacks block production was closely tied to Bitcoin block production. However, with this upgrade, miner tenure redefines this process. For the duration of one Bitcoin block, a new miner is cryptographically chosen through a preferred transfer mechanism to be the sole producer of blocks during their tenure.\n\nA critical aspect to address is the security concern regarding this cryptographic selection. Since the cryptographic process only applies to the tenure, questions can arise about what prevents a miner from acting maliciously during their production time.\n\nNakamoto addresses this security concern by altering the role of miners. While miners continue to decide the contents of blocks, Stackers now have the authority to decide whether a block is included in the chain. This distinction is designed to enhance the integrity and security of the block validation process.\n\nThis dual-role mechanism ensures that even if a miner attempts to introduce malicious blocks, these blocks must be validated by the Stackers before being added to the blockchain. This division prevents any single group from wielding excessive influence over the Stacks network. Also, it substantially improves security measures against attacks or manipulations.\n\n### Signer validation\n\nOnce a miner proposes a block, it must be validated by designated signers, an essential step that enforces security and decentralization. The miner sends the block to signers for validation. For a block to be accepted, 70% of the signers need to agree.\n\nNakamoto employs the WSTS protocol along with the FIRE extension, which facilitates scalable distributed key and signature generation. This setup is designed to manage an increasing number of participants while also addressing security challenges posed by potentially malicious Stackers.\n\nAfter validation, the block is replicated, and this process is repeated several times until the tenure changes. Unlike the Bitcoin network, which takes about 10 minutes to complete a transaction, this process takes only seconds.\n\n### Mitigating Bitcoin Miner Extractable Value (MEV)\n\nAddressing Bitcoin Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is essential to prevent miners from using their position to prioritize transactions for personal gain. Such practices could undermine the fairness and security of the blockchain.\n\nNakamoto tackles this issue through a two-stage approach to validation, involving miners and Stackers. This method establishes strict protocols that govern the order and inclusion of transactions in blocks, ensuring that all actions taken by miners adhere to a transparent and equitable framework.\n\n### Miner selection process\n\nA key component of Nakamoto is the new miner selection process, which heavily revolves around the \"Index block hash.\" This hash is crucial as it represents the first block produced by a miner and serves as a cornerstone for Bitcoin finality. The Index block hash is written to the Bitcoin blockchain when a new miner begins their tenure, linking Stacks‚Äô blockchain history directly to Bitcoin‚Äôs. As successive miners take over, they continue this chain, creating a continuous and secure record of all transactions and blocks recognized by the Stacks network.\n\nThe process begins when miners submit a block commit transaction, which includes the Index block hash. This submission is essential for the selection of new miners, as it establishes a verifiable link to the miner's previous work and the overall blockchain's state. This mechanism ensures a concrete audit trail and secures the integrity of the blockchain against potential manipulation or errors.\n\n### Miner transition\n\nWhen it's time for a change in miner tenure, a TenureChange transaction is initiated by Stackers. The entire process involved is designed with a high level of security consciousness. This TenureChange transaction data includes:\n\n- **Tenure Consensus Hash:**Represents the current tenure of the miner.\n- **Previous Tenure Consensus Hash:**As the name implies, it is the consensus hash from the previous tenure.\n- **Burn View Consensus Hash:**This is the hash of the last observed Bitcoin block.\n- **Previous Tenure End:**This is represented by an Index block hash, which is essential for informing the new miner about the starting point for their block production.\nThis comprehensive approach would not only secures the transition between miners but also maintain a continuous, decentralized, and secure validation process. This structured handover is important for maintaining the blockchain‚Äôs integrity and ensuring that each miner builds upon a verified and accepted foundation.\n\nBy reducing the average block time to mere seconds, the Nakamoto release will significantly enhance the user experience and scalability of the network.\n\nOnward With Nakamoto\n\n## Onward With Nakamoto\n\nFor years, the dialogue around blockchain technology has centered on the 'blockchain trilemma'. The theory suggests that improvements in speed and scalability typically come at the cost of decentralization. However, with the Nakamoto upgrade, Stacks is addressing these concerns head-on.\n\nNakamoto isn't just be a technological upgrade; it marks a pivotal moment for Stacks and for those invested in the future of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBy leveraging Bitcoin's security, Stacks introduces concepts like miner tenure and decentralized validation, signaling a mature approach to blockchain innovation. These changes are not merely incremental; they represent transformative shifts. They aim to make the Bitcoin network more accessible and practical for a broader range of applications than ever before.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Key Ecosystem Developments\n\nThe Stacks TVL was[$55.42 million](https://defillama.com/chain/Stacks)on January 01, 2024, and reached an all-time high TVL of $189.19 million on April 02, 2024, which is a 241.5% rise in 3 months.\n\nBut even before then, the Stacks DeFi ecosystem had been on an upward trajectory. 2023 was a banner year for the network's DeFi protocols, with[Messari‚Äôs research reports](https://messari.io/report/state-of-stacks-q4-2023)noting that:\n\n- The DeFi TVL of Q1 2023 was $26.7 million, and it surged to $61.2 million in Q4 2023, resulting in a 762.5% YoY change.\n- The TVL of Stacks‚Äô native token, STX, increased from 28.7 million in Q1 2023 to 42.9 million in Q4 2023, a 31.1% YoY change.\nLet‚Äôs look at some of the key applications that contributed to this TVL.\n\n### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\n\nDEXs built on Stacks allow users to buy, sell, trade, and swap assets with BTC. These DEXs connect users to BTC-backed assets like SIP10 tokens, BRC-20 tokens, and more so that they can engage with a growing DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin.\n\nThe TVL for Stacks DEXs has surpassed[$125 million](https://defillama.com/protocols/Dexes/Stacks), with over 97% of TVL covered by the exchanges ALEX and Bitflow.\n\n- **ALEX:**[ALEX](https://alexgo.io/)is a major decentralized exchange built on Stacks to provide users with a seamless Bitcoin DeFi experience. The network fees are to be paid using STX tokens. Users need Stack-supported wallets to buy cryptocurrencies.\n- **Bitflow:**[Bitflow](https://www.bitflow.finance/)DEX leverages technologies like Atomic Swaps, decentralized liquidity pools, layer-2 smart contracts, and Stacks Bitcoin (sBTC) to offer seamless trading features to its users.\n### Lending and Borrowing Platforms\n\nBitcoin users can use Stack-based lending and borrowing platforms to earn BTC by lending and borrowing other assets against their BTC. Here, a BTC pool is created that is controlled through the Stacks consensus. At the time of writing, the TVL of Stacks lending protocols is over[$10 million](https://defillama.com/protocols/Lending/Stacks).\n\n[Zest Protocol](https://www.zestprotocol.com/)is a lending protocol that rewards liquidity providers with BTC. Here, users can request loans with information like token amount, collateral ratio, payment period, interest rate, and more.\n\n### Stacking and Liquidity Protocols\n\n[Stacking](https://www.stacks.co/learn/stacking)allows stackers to earn STX and STX-backed tokens by participating in the network consensus mechanism. Users can Stack in a pool or individually (though they‚Äôll need to become a signer) through[Lockstacks](https://lockstacks.com/choose-stacking-method?chain=mainnet). They can also participate in Liquid Stacking, which was developed by[LISA](https://www.lisalab.io/)and[Stacking DAO](https://www.stackingdao.com/).\n\nAdditionally, users can also access protocols that allow them to interact with liquidity pools for yield farming opportunities.[Velar](https://www.velar.co/), for example, is a DeFi liquidity protocol that allows yield farming on Stacks. A liquidity pool with 15 token pairs also rewards users for adding liquidity.\n\n### Stablecoins\n\nStablecoins developed on Stacks help users reduce volatility in their assets. Moreover, users can opt for Stack platforms that allow STX token collateralizing to mint stablecoins. A number of projects like ALEX possess their own stablecoins while others help users access them.\n\n[Arkadiko](https://arkadiko.finance/)is a platform that allows one to borrow a stablecoin USDA by collateralizing STK tokens. This platform also has its native governance token, DIKO, which can be used to participate in DAO proposals.\n\n### NFT Marketplaces\n\nThe NFT marketplace development is one of the innovative developments of the Stacks ecosystem. Users can visit this marketplace to buy NFTs minted on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nPowered by Stacks,[Gamma](https://gamma.io/)is a prominent NFT marketplace that has sold over 600K NFTs. This marketplace has over 3,000 creators who have earned over $5 million to date.\n\nThe Future With Nakamoto\n\n## The Future With Nakamoto\n\nNakamoto's launch on October 28, 2024 is a huge milestone for Bitcoin DeFi. The upgrade allows core developers to fix bugs or make final adjustments as Signers come online. Currently, Nakamoto rules are active, implementing everything from fast blocks to Bitcoin finality and Signer-based functions.\n\nNow, the community will turn its attention over to[sBTC](https://sbtc.tech/#roadmap?ref=stacksroadmap), which will further drive the growth of Bitcoin DeFi in the Stacks ecosystem.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-blob",
    "Body": "## Collection History and Associated Projects\n\nThe Blob origin story isn‚Äôt a straightforward one, so we‚Äôll stick to the highlights. The collection began with the pseudonymous[Nuro](https://twitter.com/nurorealm), an artist and physician-turned-crypto enthusiast, and[Eloc](https://twitter.com/Elocremarc), who co-founded the project and is credited with building out much of its technical structure. Others have played a role in various stages of Blob development, including[ordinalHO](https://twitter.com/ordinalHO),[Steaktoshi](https://twitter.com/steaktoshi)and[Boppleton](https://twitter.com/boppleton).\n\nNuro and Eloc met online and got involved in the early days of Ordinals ‚Äì deep in the heart of crypto winter. Recognizing the potential that Ordinals had to change the energy of Bitcoin, they decided to build together. But the Blobs weren‚Äôt their first joint project. The two first began building Cypherpunk Ghosts, a 777-item collection using ghost artwork created by artist[Vinyl](https://twitter.com/0x_Vinyl)to tell the story of Bitcoin.\n\nCommunity-building was highly important to them, which led to the development of the Cypherpunk Lab. At the same time, Nuro was working to build the Nuro Realm, for which he literally inscribed some of his own brain data on-chain. When Nuro put out the artwork for Nuro Realm with a request for people to join the Blob Army, it went viral. Eloc had[also harbored](https://twitter.com/Elocremarc/status/1773230178636095518)a desire to create a generative Ordinal collection utilizing developments in Ordinals technology.\n\nThe resonance the Blobs had with others in the Bitcoin ecosystem proved to be a way to achieve these goals, so they decided to pivot their efforts. And thus, the Blobs ‚Äì which Nuro has referred to as the unifier of his projects ‚Äì were born.\n\nCollection Development\n\n## Collection Development\n\nThe tech behind the Blobs is both complex and extensive. The builders[reportedly](https://medium.com/@bitcoinsquare7/blob-army-the-romance-of-artists-and-developers-25ec5f6877f8)utilized multiple Ordinals technologies ‚Äì including parent-child inscriptions and recursive inscriptions, among others ‚Äì to build an even bigger project. The collection[was built](https://twitter.com/btc_substance/status/1777437524224548918)with React Three Fiber, using libraries inscribed by their own team. The shader code, in particular,[plays a role](https://medium.com/@bitcoinsquare7/blob-army-the-romance-of-artists-and-developers-25ec5f6877f8)in the blob‚Äôs visuals, impacting their color and shape. By using a variety of cutting edge tech, the Blob team has built a legitimately refined product.\n\nUnlike some so-called free mints where fees still apply, the 10,000 Blobs were airdropped completely free to their holders. They were inscribed ahead of time so that those acquiring a Blob would not need to pay anything for them, allowing people to experience the inscriptions in an organic way. This was highly important to the founders, who wanted to avoid a situation where money became a factor in interacting with the collection. As a result, the Blob airdrop was self-funded.\n\nCollection Concept\n\n## Collection Concept\n\nTeam Blob views themselves as experimental artists, combining Bitcoin technical innovations with scientific theory and various art forms to create. As they‚Äôve said in several interviews, they ‚Äúbelieve everyone is an artist, you just have to find your medium.‚Äù There‚Äôs a heavy focus on 3D elements in the Blob artwork and ‚Äì of course ‚Äì the recognizable laser eye motifs.\n\nDepending on where you look, you‚Äôll find different possible meanings for the name. ‚ÄòBLOB‚Äô could stand for ‚Äú[Blobs Love Other Blobs](https://twitter.com/nurorealm/status/1788166082861384067),‚Äù ‚Äú[Bitcoiners Love Bitcoiners](https://www.coinlive.com/news/what-s-so-special-about-the-blob-initiated-by-ordinals-og),‚Äù ‚Äú[Believers in Loving Our Blobs](https://www.nftmintradar.com/nft-drops/blob-army#:~:text=%22BLOB%20is%20more%20than%20just,re%20ready%20to%20make%20history!)‚Äù or even the ‚Äú[Binary Large Object](https://medium.com/@bitcoinsquare7/blob-army-the-romance-of-artists-and-developers-25ec5f6877f8)‚Äù concept in computing. It might not stand for any of those, or it might stand for all of them. The general vibe of the Blobs is blob, and to understand them, you have to blob.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs where things get epic. One of the biggest milestones to date for the team was inscribing their artwork on an epic sat, the term for a very rare satoshi. This was no ordinary sat. It was generated during the recent Bitcoin halving and as[Decrypt noted](https://decrypt.co/229804/bitcoin-epic-sat-sold-2-million-inscribed-ordinals-grimes-ai-voice), it ‚Äúwas sold for 33.3 BTC in April‚Äîaround $2.1 million at the time.‚Äù The Blobmasters inscribed it with music written, composed, and performed by[Epic Chef Steaktoshi](https://twitter.com/steaktoshi), who also used the AI-generated voice of Canadian musician Grimes, becoming the[first people](https://twitter.com/Elocremarc/status/1788118673586307501)to inscribe on an epic sat.\n\nInscription 70,634,325, the number for that landmark achievement, is being called[Spike #1](https://twitter.com/bookofblob/status/1787023956526125560), and Nuro has called it the first ‚Äúneurogenerative‚Äù 3D audiovisual piece on Ordinals ‚Äì a reference to generative AI and neurographic art.\n\nThe Community Of It All\n\n## The Community Of It All\n\nOne thing that stands out about the Blobbers is their emphasis on events and collaborations. In the middle of inscribing for their airdrop, the Blob Chiefs could be found at NFT.NYC, displaying works from the collection. On April 10, they hosted a ‚ÄúSend Blob‚Äù Space event with BitSquare; and back in February, Cypherpunk Labs and Nuro Realm collaborated with others to launch a San Francisco gallery of Ordinals art.\n\nThe Blob team‚Äôs focus on community building has played a major role in developing a robust base that can only be described as an epic army‚Ä¶ or, you know, as blob.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "nakamoto-impact-bitcoin-mev",
    "Body": "## What is Nakamoto?\n\nNakamoto is a hard fork of the Stacks L2 designed to enhance the blockchain‚Äôs performance, security, and integration with Bitcoin.\n\nWith Nakamoto, Stacks block production is no longer be tied to direct miner elections. Instead, miners produce blocks at a fixed cadence. The set of PoX Stackers uses a randomness-based selection process (sortition), influenced by miner participation in past elections. This determines when the current miner should stop producing blocks and a new miner should start.\n\nNakamoto Upgrade and Its Impact on Bitcoin MEV\n\n## Nakamoto Upgrade and Its Impact on Bitcoin MEV\n\nMiner extractable value (MEV) is a major issue which Stacks (and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem) has faced for a long time.\n\nMEV is the profit that a miner generates by selectively ordering/reordering transactions based on screening the UTXOs in Bitcoin‚Äôs mempool. As miners have access to transaction information before they are added to a block, they can create unfair conditions that benefit them before block confirmation.\n\n- **Reordering transactions:**Miners could order transactions to benefit themselves, such as by front-running profitable trades.\n- **Inserting their own transactions:**Miners could potentially add their own transactions to a block for added profit.\n- **Censoring transactions:**Miners could even choose to exclude certain transactions.\nEarlier, Stacks used a simple miner election for block production. Bitcoin miners with high hash rates held more voting power, giving them an inherent advantage in becoming Stacks leaders, too.\n\nThe Nakamoto Upgrade shifts to a sortition-based system where leader election is semi-randomized. While the Bitcoin hash rate still influences the selection process, this reduces the ability of a single Bitcoin miner or pool to dominate block production in Stacks consistently.\n\nEssentially,**Bitcoin miners are required to spend equivalent BTC to earn STX tokens**.\n\nMany MEV extractions can compound to a large loss over time. Users would also begin to rely less on the network itself.\n\nConsidering the long-term negative impacts that MEVs can cause, Nakamoto will change Stacks‚Äô approach to a manipulation-free mining process. For this, sortition factors are implemented.\n\nWhat are Nakamoto‚Äôs Sortition Probability Factors?\n\n## What are Nakamoto‚Äôs Sortition Probability Factors?\n\nSortition is essentially a randomness-based selection process weighted by factors like a miner's commitment to the network (BTC spent in Proof-of-Transfer, and other parameters).\n\nThe countermeasures to restrict miners from exploiting[MEV](https://docs.stacks.co/nakamoto-upgrade/what-is-the-nakamoto-release/nakamoto-in-10-minutes#bitcoin-mev-mitigation)from users include:\n\n- **Miner‚Äôs consistent participation:**Nakamoto will reward miners for consistent participation. To be eligible for leader selection, miners must demonstrate a recent history of block production ‚Äî participation in the last 10 blocks. This encourages a reliable and dedicated miners network.\n- **Median of past bids:**Nakamoto prevents outlier bids from unfairly influencing leader selection. It calculates a miner's probability of selection based on the median of their past BTC commitments in the Proof-of-Transfer process. This ensures fairness and reduces the impact of unusually large or small bids.\n- **Absolute bid total:**Nakamoto considers the absolute amount of BTC miners commit. This factor and others contribute to a miner's overall probability of being selected as a leader, providing transparency and predictability in the system.\nMiners receive rewards for their genuine contribution to the Stacks network without manipulative practices, which encourages other miners to follow this path.\n\nWhat is Stacks Nakamoto‚Äôs MEV Mitigation Strategy?\n\n## What is Stacks Nakamoto‚Äôs MEV Mitigation Strategy?\n\nThe[research paper](https://forum.stacks.org/uploads/short-url/bqIX4EQ5Wgf2PH4UtiZHZBqJvYE.pdf)titled ‚Äú**Bitcoin MEV Analysis for Stacks Mining**‚Äù commissioned by the Stacks Foundation discusses four practical MEV mitigation strategies:\n\n1. Proportional Coinbase Rewards (PCR)\n1. Minimum Bid Requirement (MBR)\n1. Assumed Total Commitment (ATC)\n1. Assumed Total Commitment with Carryforward (ATC-C)\n### Proportional Coinbase Rewards (PCR)\n\nThis model proposes that the Stacks Coinbase reward amount be adjusted so that the amount a miner receives is proportional to the aggregate Bitcoin commitment to win that block. Rewards are distributed based on each block's relative total Bitcoin commitments.\n\nThis method aims to disincentivize miners from making minimal Bitcoin commitments since their reward would be proportionally smaller. Plus, it encourages substantial commitments and consistent mining activity.\n\n### Minimum Bid Requirement (MBR)\n\nThe Minimum Bid Requirement (MBR) insists on the requirement for a minimum aggregated BTC funds for that particular Bitcoin block. If a miner doesn‚Äôt fulfill this requirement, Stacks sortition doesn‚Äôt occur.\n\nThe introduction of MBR prevents Bitcoin miners from executing opportunistic mining with small commitments. Moreover, if the minimum threshold is high enough, it could discourage an MEV miner from excluding other Bitcoin miners.\n\n### Assumed Total Commitment (ATC)\n\nAssumed Total Commitment (ATC) assumes a baseline total Bitcoin commitment for block sortition, regardless of the total committed. This assumed total is often based on historical data, like the median of commitments from previous blocks. The miner's probability of winning a block is their commitment divided by this assumed total.\n\nThis method discourages both minimal and opportunistic mining. It makes the rewards less dependent on lower-than-average commitments in a particular block and ensures a more level playing field by normalizing the impact of commitments across blocks.\n\n### Assumed Total Commitment with Carryforward (ATC-C)\n\nAssumed Total Commitment with Carryforward (ATC-C) is a variation of ATC where if no miner wins a sortition (because the total commitment does not meet the assumed total), the coinbase reward for that block is carried forward and distributed in future blocks. This model adds a cumulative aspect to the rewards, distributing unclaimed rewards to future blocks.\n\nLike ATC, this model discourages minimal commitments and ensures that the rewards' value is not lost but redistributed, possibly encouraging more consistent participation across multiple blocks.\n\nNakamoto‚Äôs MEV Mitigation and Ecosystem Considerations\n\n## Nakamoto‚Äôs MEV Mitigation and Ecosystem Considerations\n\nATC-C and PCR are the most viable options based on detailed research and analysis of all four solutions. These solutions have a lesser impact on the miner‚Äôs profitability over a longer period. Therefore, we'll discuss these solutions and their potential impact on the Stacks ecosystem.\n\n1. **Mining process:**PCR solution offers better allocation of rewards along with its complexity. Meanwhile, ATC-C will go forward similarly without altering much of the mining process.\n1. **Miner behavior:**ATC-C and PCR solutions won‚Äôt significantly alter the miner‚Äôs behavior.\n1. **Small vs. large miners:**ACT-C and PCR solutions don't negatively affect both small and large miners.\n1. **Stacking:**Stacking also stays unaffected for both solutions without significant differences.\n1. **Miner centralization:**The distribution of miner profitability and overall miner profitability remains stable with the implementation of PCR and ATC-C. Therefore, the possibility for an increase in miner centralization in either of these solutions is minimal.\nLeveling The Playing Field for Miners\n\n## Leveling The Playing Field for Miners\n\nNakamoto provides efficient solutions to Stacks's problems on Bitcoin MEV. As a result, this upgrade limits the possibility of minor manipulations that existed pre-Nakamoto.\n\nThe new reward system will incentivize miners to join an honest mining process, improving security and trust in the Stacks network.\n\nnan\n\n",

Unlike traditional fiat-backed stablecoins, USDh is purely Bitcoin-based, eliminating the need for banks or fiat currencies. HermeticaFi's approach to generating yield is non-custodial and trust-minimized, ensuring a decentralized and reliable platform for users.\n\nUSDh allows users to stake their USDh for sUSDh, entering into a short position against Bitcoin's future price. This strategy leverages the funding rates paid by those taking the opposite position in the futures market to generate yield.

USDh aims to offer returns up to 25%, all within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Set to launch in Q2 2024, interested users can[join the wait list now](https://www.hermetica.fi/).\n\nHermetica is also developing the stSTXearn token, a non-custodial yield product for Stackers. This automated options strategy aims to generate returns on stacked STX (stSTX) through a trend-following system. During a 4.5-year backtest period, stSTXearn achieved an average annualized return of 16.2% on STX with a 65% win rate.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin DeFi?\n\n## What Does This Mean for Bitcoin DeFi?\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/07cbbf888d5e025f2f8a61bfa43dbc77.png)\n\nStablecoins play a vital role in the DeFi sector by maintaining stable value and bridging traditional finance with decentralized finance. They enable users to lend, borrow, and generate additional yield, thus contributing to the growth and adoption of blockchain technology. USDh will empower Bitcoin users to convert their assets into a stable, non-volatile currency without leaving the Bitcoin blockchain, providing a safe haven for those looking to reduce risk.\n\nHermetica's USDh draws parallels with Ethena's USDe on the Ethereum blockchain, which rapidly grew to a[$2.3 billion](https://defillama.com/stablecoin/ethena-usde)market capitalization within three months of its launch. With Bitcoin's vast user base, including 461,000 daily active wallets, the potential for USDh is immense. On the Stacks blockchain, existing stablecoins like sUSDT, aeUSDC, and USDA have gained traction, but a yield-bearing stablecoin like USDh could significantly boost stablecoin adoption.\n\nWhy Stablecoins?\n\n## Why Stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins offer numerous advantages, particularly in developing countries where access to traditional banking is limited. During a recent Space on X, formerly Twitter, Jakob highlighted that many people in these regions desire to hold dollars but face barriers due to the lack of bank accounts. Stablecoins provide a solution, allowing individuals to store dollars on their mobile devices, accessible anytime and anywhere. They offer stability, facilitate global transfers, and provide opportunities for passive income.\n\nUSDh aims to deliver a censorship-resistant stablecoin that not only preserves value but also generates interest. The market for stablecoins is substantial, with the current supply at[$160 billion](https://defillama.com/stablecoins)and peaking at[$188 billion](https://defillama.com/stablecoins)in March 2022. By combining the benefits of stability and yield, USDh is poised to make a significant impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem and the broader crypto market.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nHermetica is set to revolutionize the Bitcoin ecosystem with its innovative Bitcoin-backed stablecoin USDh. By backing the stablecoin with Bitcoin, and having it intrinsically generate a yield, Hermetica offers a stable and secure alternative to traditional fiat-backed stablecoins.This pioneering product, along with the stSTXearn token, highlights Hermetica's commitment to providing high-yield opportunities within the Bitcoin ecosystem, all while maintaining a non-custodial and trust-minimized framework.\n\nThe potential impact of USDh on Bitcoin DeFi is immense. With the ability to convert Bitcoin into a stable, non-volatile currency, users can enjoy the benefits of stability and yield without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. This development promises to drive further adoption of stablecoins on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions like Stacks, enhancing the overall growth and maturity of the Bitcoin DeFi landscape. As the market for stablecoins continues to expand, Hermetica's contributions are poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of decentralized finance on Bitcoin.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Bitcoin's Journey Since Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nJust how far have we come since 2010? Prior to the first halving in 2012, the block reward for miners was 50 BTC. A miner would need to mine 200 blocks to come up with 10,000 BTC on rewards alone. Back then, that was far less difficult to do given how relatively few people were in the space. But now, given a block reward of 3.125 BTC, you‚Äôd need to mine 3,200 blocks to reap the same reward.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and you wouldn‚Äôt need to mine even one block to afford that order today. $41 is about 0.0005 BTC. It is impossible to overstate just how much things have changed since those very early days, just 14 months after Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs seminal whitepaper.\n\nThis year, we‚Äôre spending Bitcoin Pizza day looking specifically at how BTC transactions have evolved since 2010, from the humble beginnings of P2P address-to-address transactions, to the first exchanges, and every major milestone that has led to the present.\n\nWithout a wallet, you have nothing. The very first of these was the ‚ÄòGenesis Wallet‚Äô or Bitcoin-Qt, developed by Nakamoto and largely used for seeding the network in the early days. It was also used to complete the very first transaction on the network, when Nakamoto sent Hal Finney 10 BTC to prove the network‚Äôs capabilities.\n\nNot long after, basic software wallets that fully automated the transaction process would spring up, and mobile-native wallets like Electrum‚Äôs Android-based wallet would soon follow. These early mobile wallets drastically increased Bitcoin‚Äôs efficacy. Users could take their holdings with them wherever they went, and transact on the network on the move from two completely different points on the globe.\n\nWhat Can Bitcoin Users Do With Their BTC Today?\n\n## What Can Bitcoin Users Do With Their BTC Today?\n\nAs Bitcoin began to flow more freely, exchanges sprang up to mediate increasing demand for the digital commodity, allowing non crypto-natives to purchase BTC in fiat. Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp were all operating by 2013. While the obvious price speculation aspect of the advent of exchanges has undoubtedly resulted in Bitcoin‚Äôs growth, their existence has also helped onboard millions of crypto-curious people who believe in Bitcoin in its own right. Around this time, many more projects designed to help people transact with Bitcoin were entering the ecosystem with a brand new audience that would continue to grow.\n\nThese new projects were entering the fray at the perfect time, as well. After the 2014 Mt. Gox hack, in which 850,000 BTC was stolen from the then-biggest crypto exchange on the planet, Bitcoin builders and users started to take major steps to ensure the security of their assets and their transactions.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) was perhaps the most important of these steps. DeFi involves fully distributed financial networks that operate on permissionless and non-custodial protocols. These networks are less susceptible to the attack vectors that target centralized exchanges, and allow users to transact directly with their counterparties rather than routing transaction information and assets through third parties.\n\nDeFi has also exposed crypto holders to a wide array of Bitcoin-backed technology that has expanded the definition of what a transaction on the Bitcoin network is. Projects that host NFTs, newer protocols like Ordinals which allow users to inscribe multimedia data into their BTC, Bitcoin-native gaming, and a thriving ecosystem of crypto-native Web3 projects are all a direct result of the rise of DeFi and just the tip of the things-you-can-do-with-Bitcoin iceberg.\n\nThis brings us to where we are today, on the 14th anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day. From the very first transaction to the myriad ways Bitcoin can now be used to interact with the Web3 world ‚Äì and yes, you can still buy pizza ‚Äì Bitcoin has always been innovative.\n\nThat first transaction, a somewhat cumbersome yet inventive way of getting from no Papa John‚Äôs to Papa John‚Äôs marked the beginning of nearly a decade and a half of the community inventing new ways to interact with the world at large, build and deploy their assets in the real world, and develop an entirely new financial system.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Collection History\n\nThe first thing to understand about OMB is the speed with which it was created and released. Founder ZK_Shark was an early adherent to Ordinals theory, viewing it as a superior opportunity to Ethereum-based NFTs. He has said in several posts that he barely slept for the month of February 2023, devoted to getting the project done. He literally[quit his finance job](https://zkshark.substack.com/p/ordinals-inscriptions-and-rare-sats)to work on launching the collection.\n\nThat fervor is present in OMB‚Äôs ethos. The entire collection ‚Äì and the broader movement ‚Äì has an anarchical undercurrent. OMB practices what they refer to as ‚Äúextreme ownership,‚Äù which has no limits or restrictions. As they[posted to X last year](https://twitter.com/OrdinalMaxiBiz/status/1636129013386100736), ‚ÄúOnce you mint your OMB it is your property to do with as you choose. You may buy, sell, trade, lend, collateralize, hypothecate, inscribe over, or destroy your OMB freely.‚Äù And in a March 2023 collection manifesto (of sorts), ZK_Shark highlighted that OMB would have no enforced royalties or metadata changes and promised that it would never move to another chain.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt take long for OMB to gain notoriety. With a widely read Twitter/X account in ZK_Shark behind the project ‚Äì and the work of successful artist Tony Tafuro imbibed in the design, OMB was already destined to garner attention. But they got all that (and more) in large part due to a controversial, widely discussed guerrilla marketing campaign.\n\nHere‚Äôs the basics: OMB encouraged other projects to buy and burn CryptoPunks NFTs, which many considered to be blasphemous due to CryptoPunks value and status. But some took him up on it. Both DeGods and Bitcoin Bandits burned their CryptoPunks, earning 33 whitelist spots each for a mint. Interestingly, many of those spots were raffled off, adding to the anarchist themes. The punk burning, which OMB achieved without spending their own money, helped establish them.\n\nCollection Concept & Development\n\n## Collection Concept & Development\n\nThe collection consists of a series of black-and-white sketched heads with colorful eyes and other Bitcoin-inspired traits, hand-drawn by Tafuro. The two were acquainted through Twitter Spaces and because ZK_Shark had previously collected some of Tafuro‚Äôs art. The OMBs are rife with ‚Äú‚Çø‚Äù logos, various mantras and references to societal themes. But it‚Äôs the eyes that carry the most information.\n\nEach OMB has an eye color that corresponds with where it was inscribed. Red-eyed OMBs were the first to debut, followed by blue-eyed OMBs ‚Äì which were inscribed on block 78. This block is notable, as it was mined by the late Hal Finney. The green-eyed collection, released third, stepped it up a notch by inscribing on block 9, which was mined by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Orange-eyed OMBs, the latest drop, are similarly rare. The size of each eye collection has also increased; they[initially issued](https://medium.com/@chaisomsri96/exploring-ordinals-nfts-b60b33093121)100 Red Eyes, followed by 200 Blue Eyes, 1900 Green Eyes, and 3000 Orange Eyes, each in separate drops.\n\nThe ‚Äúon-chain paradox‚Äù of having new artwork on satoshis that were mined more than a decade ago is something ‚Äúsimply cool,‚Äù according to the creators. This achievement was possible because of the work of Nullish, who has long hunted for and studied rare satoshis.\n\nOMB has been able to build a strong, highly engaged community, as well as hype for new collections through some good old fashioned exclusivity. Whenever new eye colors have been released, some of the whitelist spots have gone to existing OMB holders. By doing this, OMB has created both a collectors‚Äô ethos for its inscriptions and an expectation that collectors will be rewarded when future ones are dropped.\n\nAssociated Projects\n\n## Associated Projects\n\nAs many supporters would attest, OMB is more than simply a collection of Ordinals. They also are mission-oriented, with a focus on educating others about Bitcoin. To that end, they created OMBounties, which they[describe](https://x.com/OMBounties/status/1709117366775562505)as ‚Äúa grants and bounties program rewarding developers, educators, and community members that contribute to the advancement of the Bitcoin network.‚Äù\n\nThe core mission of OMBounties ‚Äì which was launched in 2023 ‚Äì is to support open-source projects that promote privacy, decentralization and the concept of ‚Äúpermissionlessness.‚Äù There are[different types of bounties](https://github.com/OrdinalMaxiBiz/bounties/issues). Some are incentives for organizations or developers that undertake Bitcoin projects, while others are open and available to OMB holders on a first-come basis. By providing these bounties, OMB has created opportunities for education and further development in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nA Major Collection Milestone\n\n## A Major Collection Milestone\n\nA landmark moment for OMB came in April, when famed auction house Christie‚Äôs announced it would host an ‚ÄúOrdinal Maxi Biz‚Äù sale that showcases the collection. The Christie‚Äôs auction incorporated a variety of OMBs, including a lot with red, blue, green and orange-eyed Ordinals. It also featured three unique pieces of art: ‚ÄòArtists Journal‚Äô and ‚ÄòThis is Me‚Äô by Tony Tafuro, and ‚ÄòRecording in Progress‚Äô by berkin bags.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt the first inscription auction ‚Äì Sotheby‚Äôs hosted one last year. But OMB‚Äôs sale with Christie‚Äôs nevertheless represents a substantial moment for Ordinals. A high-profile sale such as this one demonstrates the popularity and market strength that these inscriptions have retained.\n\n‚ÄúOrdinals are such an important part of today‚Äôs Web3 and Digital Art culture,‚Äù[said](https://press.christies.com/ordinal-maxi-biz-omb-119253)Nicole Sales Giles, the Director of Digital Art Sales at Christie‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pleasure to work with ZK on this project and to dive into OMB and the fascinating developments happening on Bitcoin.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOrdinal theory and inscriptions have sparked a technical revolution that enables Bitcoin ‚Äì humanity‚Äôs most decentralized cryptocurrency ‚Äì to function as a permissionless and immutable medium for fine digital artifacts,‚Äù[commented](https://press.christies.com/ordinal-maxi-biz-omb-119253)ZK_Shark. ‚ÄúInscriptions prove Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to preserve uncensored history and cultural expressions akin to earlier humans‚Äô cave paintings. Christie‚Äôs global presence further solidify Bitcoin as the world‚Äôs top cryptocurrency and the premiere destination for fine digital artifacts and documentation. OMB Cannot Be Stopped.‚Äù\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is Bitcoin DeFi?\n\nBitcoin DeFi refers to the decentralized exchanges, lending-borrowing platforms, NFT marketplaces, and other financial protocols that leverage the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin DeFi protocols use BTC as its primary asset and the Bitcoin chain as a transaction settlement layer.\n\nThus, Bitcoin DeFi can unlock BTC's potential while relying on the Bitcoin network‚Äôs security and decentralized architecture. A Spartan research[report](https://bitcoinlayersreport.com/)suggests that Bitcoin DeFi has a 7x growth potential.\n\nThe report explains that as of December 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap was $850 billion, 3.1 times more than Ethereum‚Äôs $270 billion. But Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi TVL was $76 billion or 28% of its market cap whereas Bitcoin DeFi had just $320 million.\n\nWithout considering any additional liquidity influx and user adoption as we‚Äôre seeing today, Bitcoin DeFi already has a $238 billion market opportunity.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin DeFi faces major problems in terms of scalability and high network latency, which results in slow transaction speeds.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at how the Stacks‚Äô Nakamoto upgrade aims to address Bitcoin DeFi‚Äôs challenges.\n\nHow Does The Stacks Nakamoto Upgrade Solve Bitcoin DeFi‚Äôs 5 Challenges?\n\n## How Does The Stacks Nakamoto Upgrade Solve Bitcoin DeFi‚Äôs 5 Challenges?\n\n### No native support for programmable applications\n\nDeFi protocols don‚Äôt depend on centralized intermediaries; instead, they run on programmable smart contracts for executing financial transactions. However, the Bitcoin chain has limited programmability and doesn‚Äôt support smart contracts, so it‚Äôs difficult for developers to build direct on-chain applications.\n\nStacks solves the problem by providing smart contract programmability for complex financial transactions on the Bitcoin chain.\n\nStacks uses the Clarity programming language for its smart contracts that help developers build Bitcoin-compatible DeFi apps. The Clarity-based contracts can directly interact with Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain data and seamlessly process BTC transactions.\n\nTherefore, Stacks enables DeFi apps to simultaneously leverage the security of the decentralized Bitcoin network and unlock the value of BTC assets.\n\n### Slow transaction speeds\n\nIn traditional finance, customers are accustomed to almost instantaneous transaction settlements using banking services. If DeFi apps are to become mainstream, they must execute transactions faster.\n\nBitcoin DeFi suffers from slow transaction speeds that affect a user‚Äôs app experience. Moreover, transaction delays can negatively impact users when they trade on a crypto exchange, especially during high market volatility.\n\nThe Stacks network introduced microblocks to improve transaction speeds for Bitcoin DeFi apps. The microblocks receive transactions from the mempool and validate them before updating on the Bitcoin chain.\n\nHowever, Stacks couldn‚Äôt guarantee proper transaction storage in the microblocks, and new miners could remove recently confirmed transactions. The Nakamoto upgrade aims to resolve the problem through an indexed block hash, the first block hash of the previous Stack miner.\n\nWith Nakamoto, miners can add the indexed block hash to the Bitcoin chain during the block commit transaction. Thus, the Nakamoto upgrade ensures faster DeFi transactions by facilitating smoother data synchronization between Stacks and Bitcoin.\n\n### Delayed block finality\n\nBlock[finality](https://leather.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin-finality-achieving-100-bitcoin-finality-with-stacks)refers to the process when Bitcoin DeFi transactions become finalized and irreversible on the Bitcoin blockchain. Changing transaction history after achieving Bitcoin finality is difficult as it requires huge computational power and economic resources.\n\nFor Bitcoin DeFi apps, quick block finality is necessary to ensure the transaction settlement is final and unchangeable. However, Bitcoin suffers from slow block confirmation time, which affects DeFi‚Äôs performance.\n\nThe original Stacks design faced a similar problem with a slow block time of around 10 minutes. Stacks was slow because its block production rate was fixed to the Bitcoin block production in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, the Stacks Nakamoto upgrade reduces block production time to around 5 seconds by de-coupling the Stacks and Bitcoin‚Äôs block production. Post-Nakamoto Stacks achieves 100% Bitcoin finality much faster through tenure-based block production.\n\nEach Bitcoin block begins a new tenure where a single miner can mine several Stacks blocks instead of just one block. The tenure-based mechanism speeds up block finality, thereby helping DeFi apps achieve faster transaction settlements on Bitcoin.\n\n### Lack of scalability\n\nMost blockchains, including Bitcoin, suffer from the blockchain trilemma, where they can‚Äôt do justice to all three elements of blockchain security: decentralization, security, and scalability. For Bitcoin, the network remains highly secure and decentralized but lacks scalability.\n\nA surge in user activity leads to network congestion and high network latency, resulting in slow transaction confirmation time. However, Bitcoin DeFi apps must handle a large volume of transactions without compromising on speed and efficiency.\n\nStacks address the scalability challenges by increasing transaction throughput and reducing processing time. The Nakamoto upgrade further bolsters Stacks with enhanced scalability to address Bitcoin DeFi‚Äôs rising demand.\n\n### No composability\n\nDeFi apps must be composable for optimum fund usage and seamless asset transfers. Composability refers to the DeFi app‚Äôs characteristics by which digital assets can interact with multiple protocols for diverse use cases.\n\nSince Bitcoin cannot do much beyond peer-to-peer transactions, DeFi operations become difficult. Thus, L2s like Stacks make DeFi apps composable so developers can build any protocol by leveraging the BTC assets.\n\nThe Stacks Nakamoto upgrade enhances Bitcoin DeFi‚Äôs composability by encouraging developers to develop apps using the human-readable Clarity programming language. These DeFi apps, like a lending protocol or an automated market maker, make BTC transactions easier across different apps.\n\nThe Future Of DeFi Lies With Bitcoin\n\n## The Future Of DeFi Lies With Bitcoin\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade has made Stacks conducive for Bitcoin DeFi protocols by offering immediate block finality and faster transaction speeds. Nakamoto will play a crucial role in unlocking the liquidity of underutilized BTC reserves.\n\nIn many ways, Stacks has ensured that the future of DeFi does, indeed, lie with Bitcoin.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Collection History\n\nThe initial goal of Bitcoin Frogs was pretty simple. As creator Frogtoshi writes, ‚ÄúOne fine day I woke up and wanted to put 10,000 frogs on the Bitcoin blockchain at all costs.‚Äù To do so, Frogtoshi partnered with Deezy, a Lightning Network Bitcoin company that also helps projects launch Ordinals collections.\n\nThe project began when Deezy‚Äôs[VibeGawd](https://twitter.com/vibes_gawd)and Frogtoshi connected online. Frogtoshi had already curated the art for the collection and was looking to do a (mostly) free mint, where the only cost to buyers would be the transaction fee for the inscription. At that time, Deezy was one of a limited number of launchpad programs, and they were[the only one accepting lightning payments](https://twitter.com/dannydiekroeger/status/1723015658731082132)for a collection mint. This made their partnership a natural choice, though nothing like what they were attempting had been done at the time.\n\nThat‚Äôs because Bitcoin Frogs was early to the Ordinals game ‚Äì and not just early, really early. They weren‚Äôt technically the first 10K collection inscribed, but they‚Äôre up there. (Although NodeMonkes launched months after Bitcoin Frogs,[they technically are the ‚Äúearlier‚Äù 10K collection](https://nftnow.com/guides/a-guide-to-nodemonkes-10k-pixelated-ordinals-explained/), having been inscribed in February 2023.) They were, however, the first to be minted via the Lightning Network, and they quickly became counted among Ordinals protocol‚Äôs pioneers.\n\nA landmark moment for Bitcoin Frogs ‚Äì and for the Ordinals ecosystem ‚Äì came in May 2023, when Bitcoin Frogs surpassed the Ethereum-based Bored Ape NFTs for trading volume over a 24-hour period. This was widely viewed as evidence of the increasing strength of the Bitcoin protocol, particularly in the NFT space, as it represented proof that Ordinals could draw the same type of trading interest and volume as other protocols.\n\nCollection Development\n\n## Collection Development\n\nBitcoin Frogs wasn‚Äôt Deezy‚Äôs first launch ‚Äì they‚Äôd previously handled the 3K debut of Astral Babes. However, no one had really done anything like the Bitcoin Frogs 10K mint. (The founder of Deezy Labs, Danny, later acknowledged that they hadn‚Äôt requested a Frogs allocation from the launch because they were skeptical of the project.)\n\nBut their technical support was integral in the Frogs‚Äô release, which was ‚Äì to put it lightly ‚Äì a little bit bumpy. Partway through the minting process, it was discovered that there was an issue with the image layering, and all the frogs that had already been minted were effectively ‚Äúnaked,‚Äù with their clothing showing up behind them.\n\nBy that point, there were roughly 2,000 frogs minted, with another 3,000 in the mempool. (At the time, community members began jokingly referring to them as ‚ÄúOnly Frogs.‚Äù These days, they‚Äôre commonly referred to as ‚Äúnaked frogs.‚Äù) The team ultimately decided to do a costly Replace-by-Fee (RBF) to replace the pending frogs in the mempool, a costly practice ‚Äì Deezy Labs actually ended up losing money on the mint, even accounting for their margin. As a sign of gratitude, Frogtoshi gifted the team a Frog. But, as many know, the frogs quickly took off, turning things around and becoming highly successful.\n\nCollection Concept\n\n## Collection Concept\n\nThere are two types of art to discuss when it comes to Bitcoin Frogs ‚Äì their visuals, and their rarity traits. The PFPs themselves are multicolored frogs in clothing, set against a colorful backdrop. Different frogs have their own looks and styles. But an interesting artistic choice is also hiding beneath the surface. One choice the creators made was to ensure that the rarity of all traits within the layers are equal. This allows buyers to select their frog based on subjective taste or aesthetics.\n\nIt also had additional benefits. Firstly, as Frogtoshi[stated](https://ordinals.forsale/2023/03/14/exclusive-interview-with-bitcoin-frogs-ordinals-10k-collection/), leveling the ‚Äúaesthetics rarity [helps] level the field and encourage‚Ä¶ satoshi rarity to emerge.‚Äù But it also helped strengthen the community. Between the free mint and the equalized aesthetic rarity, buyers really had the opportunity to lean into their own tastes. Holders often will post their frogs on social media, with phrases like ‚ÄúThis is me!‚Äù, ‚Äúfrogs follow frogs‚Äù, or simply, ‚ÄúRibbit!‚Äù\n\nBut if you have so far missed out on acquiring a frog, you‚Äôll have to do so on the secondary market. The 10K cap is firm, according to Frogtoshi. As the founder said in[an interview](https://ordinals.forsale/2023/03/14/exclusive-interview-with-bitcoin-frogs-ordinals-10k-collection/): ‚ÄúAs it is for traditional art, a hard cap on supply helps grow the value organically amongst true art collectors.‚Äù\n\nnan\n\n",

The demand for Runes also led us to seek more avenues for our users to mint, etch, and transfer Rune tokens.\n\nThis included integrations with:\n\n### Ordzaar\n\nMany Ordinals enthusiasts are familiar with Ordzaar. Aside from their Ordinals marketplace,[Ordzaar](https://ordzaar.com/)also focuses on giving artists a simple and permissionless launchpad for their Ordinal collections.\n\n### Inscrib3\n\nIf you‚Äôre not familiar with the PIPE protocol, using the tools available on[Inscrib3](https://pipe.inscrib3.land/create-open-art)is a great way to get started. It‚Äôs a platform built on PIPE that lets users mint, deploy, and buy and sell PIPE tokens and NFTs (known as PIPE art). The platform also has an open source explorer that allows users to verify ownership and view the latest data on PIPE tokens and art.\n\n### CraftRunes\n\n[CraftRunes](https://craftrunes.com/)is currently in beta, but users can still connect their Leather wallet to mint, etch, and transfer Runes. If you mint and etch enough Runes, your wallet address could be featured on a ‚ÄúTop 10 Wallets‚Äù leaderboard, which showcases CraftRunes‚Äô most active users.\n\n### Stamped.Ninja\n\n[Stamped.Ninja](https://stamped.ninja/)is more than just a Bitcoin Stamps and SRC-20 marketplace; it‚Äôs also a project dedicated to supporting Stamps artists. The Stamped.Ninja team states that artists receive 3 percent royalties on each sale (conditions detailed[here](https://stampedninja.gitbook.io/stamped.ninja/how-to-get-royalties-on-stamp)), giving Stamps creators an additional way to support their work beyond direct sales.\n\n### Light Finance\n\n[Light Finance](https://www.lightfinance.xyz/)is a cross-chain pending protocol for Bitcoin L2s that hinges on the Light stablecoin. It is, according to the Light Finance team, the first and only stablecoin that uses leverage across Bitcoin L2s to funnel earnings to Photon users. Light users can borrow, mint, and leverage Light over Bitcoin L2s, as well as stake their Light and Photon.\n\nPutting Your Bitcoin to Work with Leather\n\n## Putting Your Bitcoin to Work with Leather\n\nOf course, these new integrations are just a snapshot of what we‚Äôre working on at Leather.

    "Body": "## A Brief History Of Introducing Scalability To Bitcoin\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/e05ff51908893456e1ac474e2d7a3703.png)\n\nThe Segregated Witness (SegWit) update in July 2017 was one of the first major steps towards making Bitcoin more scalable. It reduced transaction times and increased the block capacity from the 1 MB limit to approximately 4 MB.\n\nThe Taproot update in November 2021 was the next significant upgrade, introducing new protocols like Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR). Taproot removed caps on maximum per-transaction data and made transaction signing more efficient, increasing overall network speed.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin layer 2s that operate on top of the layer 1 network have played the most important role in Bitcoin scalability. These L2s have expanded Bitcoin‚Äôs utility by facilitating off-chain transactions, enabling smart contract programmability, and increasing transaction throughput.\n\nOne of the foremost Bitcoin L2s, Stacks, launched in 2021, has provided an impetus to the Bitcoin economy by unlocking BTC productivity.\n\nStacks & Bitcoin Scalability\n\n## Stacks & Bitcoin Scalability\n\nThe initial iteration of Stacks still needed significant improvements to make Bitcoin truly scalable.\n\nFirst, Stacks had a slow[block finality](https://leather.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin-finality-achieving-100-bitcoin-finality-with-stacks)time because Stacks‚Äô block production was directly linked to Bitcoin in a 1:1 ratio. Since it takes approximately 10 minutes to produce a Bitcoin block, Stacks transactions had a similar confirmation time.\n\nSecond, Stacks used microblocks to store unconfirmed transactions from the mempool before validating and writing them to the Bitcoin chain. Although microblocks theoretically improved transaction time, they couldn‚Äôt guarantee proper transaction data storage because new miners could remove confirmed transactions.\n\nThird, Stacks was earlier prone to blockchain reorganization or reorgs because it was cheaper to reorganize the latest Stacks blocks. Reorgs occur when validators disagree on a chain‚Äôs accuracy and remove blocks, delaying transaction confirmation times.\n\nThus, Stacks‚Äô earlier version had a high network latency that slowed apps down and affected scalability. However, the Stacks Nakamoto upgrade is addressing the problems and will empower developers to build scalable DeFi apps.\n\nThe Nakamoto Upgrade‚Äôs Contribution Towards Bitcoin Scalability\n\n## The Nakamoto Upgrade‚Äôs Contribution Towards Bitcoin Scalability\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade will grow Bitcoin scalability through a tenure-based block production system that has reduced block production time to approximately 5 seconds. The new mechanism would delink Stacks and Bitcoin‚Äôs block production to improve transaction processing time.\n\nIn the tenure system, Stacks adopts a cryptography-based sortition procedure that algorithmically selects a new miner to validate transactions and create blocks. Each new Bitcoin block begins a fresh tenure, and a single miner can mine several Stacks blocks instead of just one block within the tenure.\n\nStackers approve each miner‚Äôs block to ensure its validity and mutually agree on the last signed block. Thus, Stackers and miners work together to achieve faster transaction speeds and block production, thereby increasing network scalability.\n\nThe other important part of the Nakamoto upgrade is writing Stacks transaction data on the Bitcoin chain with an indexed block hash. An indexed block hash is the first block hash of the previous Stacks miner they mined during their tenure.\n\nMiners add the indexed block hash to the Bitcoin chain during the block commit transaction, offering complete Bitcoin finality. The block hash resolves miner connectivity problems and offers extra security to Stacks transactions.\n\nFinally, Stacks uses a variation of the Assumed Total Commitment With Carryforward (ATC-C) strategy to mitigate the Miner Extractable Value (MEV) problem. The MEV is a manipulative way through which miners can alter transaction orders to make profits.\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade ensures miners participate in the last ten blocks to qualify for cryptographic sortition and reduces extreme bidding behavior. Such methods reward genuine miners and fast-track the block confirmation time for a scalable network.\n\nScalable Apps Are The Key To Bitcoin DeFi\n\n## Scalable Apps Are The Key To Bitcoin DeFi\n\n[Bitcoin DeFi](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-bitcoin-defi)apps need to process a huge volume of transactions without compromising on speed and efficiency. These apps must handle user activity surges without affecting transaction confirmation times.\n\nThe Stacks Nakamoto upgrade enables developers to build scalable apps for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. Post-Nakamoto Stacks offers a user experience comparable to present-day traditional finance apps.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-pizza-ninjas",
    "Body": "## The Concept Behind Pizza Ninjas\n\nOne of the first things to understand about Pizza Ninjas is that everything ‚Äì even the silly ‚Äì is deliberate. Take the name, for instance. The collection is inscribed on[rare pizza satoshis](https://ninjalerts.gitbook.io/bitcoin-ordinals-pizza-ninjas/why-ninjas-+-pizza). (The term ‚Äòpizza satoshis‚Äô comes from the 10,000 BTC programmer Laszlo Hanyecz used in May 2010 to purchase two Papa John‚Äôs pizzas ‚Äì the first known use of bitcoin to purchase physical goods. This transaction has come to be celebrated annually within the crypto community and is known as[‚ÄúBitcoin Pizza Day.‚Äù](https://leather.io/blog/the-legacy-of-bitcoin-pizza-day))\n\nAnd then there‚Äôs the color schemes. The collection features a distinctive orange background that they describe as mathematically chosen. In the design process, Ninjalerts called upon cofounder and color scientist Max Savin, who utilized Pantone-compatible colors to ensure the art would look consistent across platforms and printers.\n\nEven the design choices ‚Äì from the bottom-up ‚Äì were intentional. Because the project was designed as a Twitter/X-first project, every Ninja has room for the emoji and hands that appear at the top of the icon on Twitter Spaces.\n\nBut the truly unusual element of Pizza Ninjas is their level of function. Unlike many static PFP collections, Pizza Ninjas are customizable. They have an extremely high pixel rate, allowing for dynamic resizing while maintaining the quality of the image. You can adjust the content, apply animation effects and use it for branding purposes within your own business. You can even play games with it.\n\nAn on-chain Super Nintendo emulator allows holders to play 90s SNES games inside their PFP, with two-player support and gamepad compatibility. They also[provide](https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/pizza-ninjas)a lifetime license to Ordinals Portfolio Tracker & Wallet Watching software by Ninjalerts, a membership pass to their alpha group featuring collabs and allowlist giveaways to top projects.‚Äù In essence, each Ninja is ‚Äú[more like an app than a PFP.](https://magisat.io/collection/pizza-ninjas)‚Äù\n\nHistory of Pizza Ninjas\n\n## History of Pizza Ninjas\n\nThe Pizza Ninjas collection was born out of a desire to create a new type of on-chain PFP ‚Äì the idea of ‚ÄúArt as an Application.‚Äù Ninjalerts[wanted to leverage what makes Bitcoin unique](https://ninjalerts.gitbook.io/bitcoin-ordinals-pizza-ninjas)by focusing on what would not be easy to do on a protocol like Ethereum. That led them to pursue creative functions like the game emulator, which they felt tied in well with their 90s aesthetic.[As they wrote](https://ninjalerts.gitbook.io/bitcoin-ordinals-pizza-ninjas), ‚ÄúOrdinals is far superior in terms of lower cost and complexity to create large-scale, fully on-chain, programmable applications embedded into digital artwork.‚Äù\n\nThe Ninjas were also built to be at-home in the spaces where web3 communities thrive: places like X and Discord. The team[specifically built](https://ninjas.pizza/)Pizza Ninjas to look ‚Äúdistinctive, clean, and awesome on X,‚Äù and incorporated an animated gif inscribed on the same Ordinal that can be used on holders‚Äô Discords to enliven their interactions.\n\nBut the partnership with Boozy.btc also played a huge role. As a seasoned NFT artist, Boozy had an existing community of enthusiasts from his previous projects. This artistic style meshed well with the Ninjalerts goals and helped to improve its resiliency.\n\nDevelopment of Pizza Ninjas\n\n## Development of Pizza Ninjas\n\nThe Pizza Ninjas collection is firmly at the[forefront of Ordinals technology](https://freenft.com/channels/ninjalerts). They utilized recursive inscriptions to achieve their high resolution, as well as parent-child endpoints to give holders the ability to make customizations. The team announced early on that they are planning to expand their code over time, and pioneered the use of the Sat Endpoint, making them the first collection to introduce holder permissioned upgradability. This basically allows holders to upgrade to newer versions of their assets over time without splitting up the collection.\n\nThe small size of the project was deliberate, and each Ninja was designed to meet[five principles](https://ninjas.pizza/):\n\n1. Make every PFP simple, consistent, and unique.\n1. Differentiate through eyes and head accessories.\n1. Go a little extra, but only if it slaps.\n1. Combine colors carefully and intentionally.\n1. Pay homage to Web3 culture, nostalgia, and Ordinals.\nBy limiting it to 1,500, the creators were able to exert greater focus on quality control, design aesthetics and developing technological advancements. This is reflected in the Ninjas community, where use of the PFPs is heavy and enthusiastic.\n\nAll Ninjas are also licensed to holders under a ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Be Evil‚Äù commercial license. This means that the Ordinals truly belong to the holders, who can use them for anything from branding a business to sublicensing. Owners can make changes or derivative products from their inscriptions ‚Äì and what‚Äôs more, the license is irrevocable. This gives holders maximum control over their inscription, because the license cannot be made more restrictive down the line.\n\nA Landmark Moment For Pizza Ninjas\n\n## A Landmark Moment For Pizza Ninjas\n\nA huge moment came for the collection in March 2024, when auction house[Sotheby‚Äôs featured one of their inscriptions](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/bitcoin-ordinals-sat-hunting/pizza-ninja-1-inscribed-pizza-uncommon-267-560-000), known as ‚ÄúThe Angel.‚Äù This was the first Pizza Ninja inscribed on Bitcoin and was done so on an Uncommon Pizza sat that came from the infamous Papa John‚Äôs transaction.\n\nIt was the first ‚Äì and at that point only ‚Äì inscription that had been done on an Uncommon Pizza sat, of which only 201 exist. The PFP sold for $139,700 USD, well above Sotheby‚Äôs initial estimate of $20,000-$30,000 USD. This demonstrated the staying power of the collection, as well as eagerness for a historic piece of it.\n\nTo this day, Pizza Ninjas is still one of the most coveted collections in the Ordinals sphere. The collection's staying power speaks to its enduring presence in the Bitcoin community and its dedication to growing the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What are Crypto Bridges?\n\n[Bridges](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-bridges)are vital for the crypto ecosystem, enabling the transfer of tokens and data across networks. They are essential for achieving cross-chain interoperability, a key aspect of the expanding DeFi ecosystem. However, bridges also come with risks, as evidenced by[significant breaches](https://defillama.com/hacks)like $624 million stolen from Ronin, $570 million from Binance Bridge, and $326 million from Wormhole. These incidents underscore the importance of choosing reputable and secure bridge solutions to protect assets.\n\n### Types of Bridges: Validator-Based vs. Light Client\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/eaf6917be3da2811539b8d9ef74b0730.png)\n\nBridges can be broadly categorized into validator-based and light-client bridges, differing in how they verify data from the source chain on the target chain. Validator-based bridges use a set of validators to verify and relay data, acting as a security layer between the source and target chains. The security in this model is tied to the amount of capital validators stake, meaning more staked capital typically equates to higher security. However, this approach can lead to higher costs and necessitates trust in the validators.\n\nConversely, light-client bridges use a lightweight verification approach performed by the bridge contract itself, resulting in a more decentralized and trustless system. This design is typically more cost-effective and efficient, requiring less infrastructure and capital. However, light-client bridges can be more complex to implement and maintain, potentially needing more resources for upkeep.\n\nUX Challenges with Crypto Bridges\n\n## UX Challenges with Crypto Bridges\n\nUsing crypto bridges presents several user experience (UX) challenges due to the inherent complexity of blockchain technology and the necessity of secure cross-chain transactions.\n\n### Security concerns\n\nCrypto bridges handle large amounts of value, making them prime targets for hackers. Users must trust that their funds are secure, which can be daunting given the history of breaches in the crypto space.\n\n### Complexity and usability\n\nThe underlying technology of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is intricate, often making it difficult for the average user to understand how to use crypto bridges safely and efficiently. This complexity can lead to user errors and potential loss of funds. Additionally, the existence of various wallet providers, each supporting different networks, adds to the confusion. Many crypto bridges suffer from non-intuitive interfaces, further complicating the user experience and increasing the likelihood of errors.\n\n### Cost and speed\n\nUsing crypto bridges can be costly due to the resources needed to process transactions and the fees charged by bridge operators. Besides bridge fees, users must also pay network transaction fees, making asset transfers between blockchains expensive. The process of transferring assets can also be slow, especially during periods of high network congestion, leading to long wait times and user frustration. This delay can be unsettling for new users, as assets seem to \"disappear\" from their wallets during the bridging period.\n\n### Interoperability challenges\n\nWith 290 different networks listed on Defillama alone, achieving seamless interoperability remains a significant challenge. Each blockchain has its own set of rules and protocols, and while crypto bridges aim to connect these disparate systems, making this process user-friendly is an ongoing struggle.\n\nCrypto Bridges and the Future of Interoperability\n\n## Crypto Bridges and the Future of Interoperability\n\nTeleportDAO is a noteworthy initiative in the blockchain interoperability space, addressing the need for secure and trustless connections between blockchains. With its innovative light-client bridge and dApps like TeleSwap and TeleOrdinal, it showcases the potential of decentralized solutions to enhance the multi-chain world.\n\nHowever, the broader landscape of crypto bridges highlights both their importance and the challenges they face. From security risks to user experience hurdles, it's clear that while bridges are essential for cross-chain interoperability, they also require careful consideration and ongoing improvement. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, projects like TeleportDAO will play a crucial role in shaping a more interconnected and accessible blockchain future.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## History of Birds of a Feather and Associated Projects\n\nFirst of all, the names of this collection‚Äôs creators might have looked familiar to you. That would be fair, because the Pandemonium group is composed of veteran Bitcoin builders, each of whom has other recognizable projects to their name. Project Lead Brett Herskope, for example, is affiliated with the NFT marketplace and web3 platform Gamma. The approach to building Birds of a Feather ‚Äì and its related projects ‚Äì reflects their experience and ethos. Unlike many other collections, there‚Äôs nothing speculative (or influencer-based) about the Birds.\n\nThat‚Äôs because these black-and-white birds aren‚Äôt really a standalone project. Rather, they‚Äôre part of the broader umbrella of The Pandemonium, which is also responsible for Parrot Radio, the OrdiGallery and multiple other projects. According to the[creators](https://thepandemonium.io/radio), Parrot Radio is ‚Äúa web3 native mobile music app for all your audio and audiovisual NFTs,‚Äù and OrdiGallery is an immersive Bitcoin art gallery. Each ordinal you hold unlocks a premium OrdiGallery, which they had already launched a version of before the collection itself dropped. Including gallery access in PFP ownership provides a utility beyond the art itself and is an unusual perk for those in the Bird community ‚Äì especially when you consider that it was available pre-mint.\n\nAnother striking thing to note about the Birds builders is how eager they are to spotlight and credit other creators and other collections. While many inscription projects have dedicated social media followings that post actively about the collection, Pandemonium also makes time to regularly hype up others. A quick scroll through their Twitter/X page is all it takes to see individualized shout-outs to[their holders](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1797816484544340301),[other collections](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1787074595809542429),[other creators](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1714065469773152403), and[other artists](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1790659871093985640). The decision to acknowledge and drive awareness to others‚Äô work isn‚Äôt unique to Pandemonium, but the volume at which they do it is notable.\n\nConcept of Birds of a Feather\n\n## Concept of Birds of a Feather\n\nThe BoaF art is striking to look at. Each of the inscriptions contains a monochrome parrot set against a grayscale or black backdrop and decked out in various clothing. But if you want to really understand the artwork, the devil is in the details. Many of the collection visuals are full of subtle, yet recognizable pop culture references ‚Äì from Steamboat Willie ([the original inspiration for the set](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1752035895283462627)) to Kurt Cobain. A combination of[vintage Disney](https://twitter.com/eliherf1/status/1752085677230182864)and The Artist‚Äôs signature street-culture style is heavily woven throughout the project.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just pop culture, either. There are also plenty of crypto-culture references, like a pizza-chomping parrot that references the famous[Laszlo Hanyecz](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1752035941248901556)-Papa John‚Äôs transaction (the first documented good purchased with Bitcoin). There‚Äôs even a[reference to Leather](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1760494168693150116), with a parrot bearing a leather jacket as a dedication for participating in the Birds of a Feather minting process.\n\nBirds of a Feather Development\n\n## Birds of a Feather Development\n\nOne of the things the Birds builders[emphasize](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1786615225174945846)is that this collection was designed ‚Äúintentionally for artists and collectors.‚Äù They pride themselves on the fact that they had already built and delivered the Ordi Gallery before the Birds of a Feather mint, meaning that each holder‚Äôs Bird was a key to unlock an existing gallery as soon as they acquired it. As Herskope[wrote](https://twitter.com/eliherf1/status/1780083829035970777), this means that holders are not buying based on speculation about what might get delivered later.\n\nAt one point, there was meant to be double the number of Birds than there actually ended up being. The collection was[designed as a 25 kb file](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1743058217507123616)size back when fees would‚Äôve been low. Because of fee hikes, that price rocketed up. The creators‚Äô interest in protecting the holders and keeping costs fair led them to chop it down to 500.\n\nBut because they minted at 0.001 BTC when the price was around $40,000 USD, BoaF was[essentially a $40 mint](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1762272014184984955)without any[access-gatekeeping](https://twitter.com/eliherf1/status/1799668127703425310). This price point is particularly generous when you consider that the Pandemonium team did all this with ‚Äú[0 funding](https://twitter.com/ThePand3monium/status/1755712327088029817).‚Äù They also made it easy to mint, using their own website with Gamma‚Äôs API and integrating numerous BTC wallets. By building such a user-friendly, cost-effective collection, they increased opportunities for access and participation for all.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## A Recap of Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nCasey Rodarmor, a Bitcoin developer, launched Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in January 2023. This protocol allows inscribing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) equivalents on Bitcoin's smallest denomination, satoshis (1 BTC = 100 million satoshis).\n\nThe introduction of[Ordinals](https://ordinals.com/)allows the inscription of digital content to satoshis, such as images, music, videos, and more. This digital inscription process facilitates the possibility of creating rare and unique assets like NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAn Overview of the Nakamoto Upgrade\n\n## An Overview of the Nakamoto Upgrade\n\nThe Stacks[Nakamoto upgrade](https://docs.stacks.co/nakamoto-upgrade/what-is-the-nakamoto-release/nakamoto-in-10-minutes)is an initiative to improve its blocks security and transaction speed. The upgrade launched in October and has improved the overall capability of the Bitcoin ecosystem by allowing developers to build projects for the growing crypto community.\n\n[Stacks](https://stacks.org/)introduces an ocean of opportunities on the Bitcoin blockchain by facilitating fully expressive (enhanced functionality to power dApps) smart contracts. The upgrade preserves Bitcoin‚Äôs USPs, such as security, while expanding its utility from being a mere store of value.\n\nNakamoto Upgrade's Impact on Ordinals' Growth\n\n## Nakamoto Upgrade's Impact on Ordinals' Growth\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade will play a crucial role in the Ordinal's growth by fostering the components such as:\n\n### Reduced block times\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade reduces the time needed to create Stacks blocks significantly. Here, the existing block time, which is about 10 minutes (due to being coupled with Bitcoin), can be brought down to approximately five seconds following the update.\n\nStacks can benefit from the faster block times as their block production is not tied to the Bitcoin blocks after the update. Moreover, this detachment from the Bitcoin block also reduces the time to confirm Slacks transactions.\n\nThe Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism helps Slacks achieve this reduced block times. Here, miners use the stacking method, where STX tokens are locked up to produce and secure the Stack blocks.\n\nNakamoto upgrade started rolling out on April 22, 2024, at Bitcoin block 840,360 in a two-step process. The total number of Ordinal inscriptions on the day Nakamoto started to roll out was over[66 million](https://dune.com/queries/2008613/3324931). This inscription rate is rising with time, indicating the positive impact of this upgrade on Ordinals.\n\nThe rise in Ordinal inscriptions has caused congestion on the Bitcoin network, leading to energy demands, slower transaction speeds, and higher fees. Due to its limited block size and decentralized nature, storing images or data directly on the Bitcoin chain also carries a premium. Only the most valuable or important data should be stored on Bitcoin L1.\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade with reduced block speed facilitates the Bitcoin NFT community to opt for[Stacks NFTs](https://www.stacks.co/explore/nfts), reducing the burden on the Bitcoin mainnet while supporting the parallel growth of Ordinals.\n\nThe increased block speed solves one of the biggest challenges Stacks users and developers face. Improved block time with the Nakamoto upgrade can translate to faster transactions and greater adoption of Ordinals.\n\n### Improved security\n\nWith the Nakamoto upgrade, Stacks aims to make its network as secure as Bitcoin's while ensuring near-instant block finality. Implementing 100% Bitcoin finality safeguards the reversal of Stacks transactions, guaranteeing their reliability and immutability.\n\nBefore Nakamoto, Stacks functioned under its security budget. The history of Stacks chains was considered to finalize the Stacks transactions. However, this finalizing process carried security risks as an attacker could potentially rewrite the transaction history by outspending the Stacks miners.\n\nNakamoto upgrade prevents Stacks from forking independently and mandates miners to build at the protocol level. This upgrade prevents the attacker from changing the history and makes Stacks transactions irreversible and as final as Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe global investment firm Franklin Templeton posted on X supporting Ordinals and Bitcoin's layer 2 solutions, mentioning their importance in addressing Bitcoin's economic security problems and increasing BTC's utility from a mere store of value. Acceptance from financial giants will be vital for Ordinals to grow towards the next level.\n\nThis implementation of 100% finality enables the nodes to participate in the Bitcoin network's inherent security framework. This improved security feature safeguards the Stacks' network against potential attacks, making it safer for users and developers.\n\nThe strengthened security after the implementation also facilitates users' interest in Ordinals. With this upgrade, Ordinals also gains security, adding more trust from the NFT community and leading to its growth.\n\n### Newer Ordinal use cases\n\nNakamoto's upgrade improves scalability, block speed, and security, resulting in an overall hassle-free developer experience. The increase in speed of the block times paves the way for adding blockheight parameters within the smart contracts. Nakamoto upgrade uses Clarity-version 3 to address the increased block speed.\n\nA fast-emerging fascinating use case is the idea of Bitcoin-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nBy enabling the inscription of arbitrary data onto individual satoshis, Ordinals can represent membership tokens, voting rights, or even the rules and logic that govern the DAO's operations.\n\nThe total number of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) surpassed[50,000](https://deepdao.io/organizations)as of June 2024, with a total treasury valued at over $28 billion. With the Nakamoto upgrade, developers can now confidently start working on the untapped Bitcoin DAO space to expand the potential of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers can build DAO projects that require users to hold Ordinal NFTs and STX tokens to become members. This collaborative approach helps to foster the growth of Ordinals, Stacks, and Bitcoin DAOs.\n\nThe improved developer-friendly interface and tools help attract more developers to join and create Bitcoin-based projects. The increase in the Bitcoin-based developer community will, in turn, help boost the growth of the Ordinals and the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n### Improved incentivization\n\nWith the rollout of the Nakamoto upgrade, Bitcoin‚Äôs incentive structure has also been updated, benefiting multiple actors. These include:\n\n- **Stackers:**As a vital part of the Stack‚Äôs consensus mechanism and helping improve security, stackers are eligible for more rewards after the update.\n- **Miners:**The Nakamoto upgrade has reshaped miners' incentives beyond transaction fees. The new sorting process enables fair bidding and consistent participation, encouraging active engagement in the network.\n- **Node Operators:**Faster block times add more responsibility and incentives to node operators. Operators now need to streamline and upgrade their operational capacity to manage the network's improved efficiency after Nakamoto.\nFollowing the Nakamoto upgrade, these increased incentives will play a crucial role in bringing more stackers, miners, and node operators into the Bitcoin ecosystem. As the Stacks ecosystem continues to expand and evolve, Ordinals are poised to benefit from the increased accessibility and growth of Bitcoin DeFi.\n\nThe Future of Ordinals & Nakamoto\n\n## The Future of Ordinals & Nakamoto\n\nThe Nakamoto upgrade is a catalyst for a broader Bitcoin renaissance. By dramatically reducing block times, improving security, and bettering developer experiences, the upgrade catalyzes Bitcoin ecosystem. Ordinals directly stand to benefit significantly from the overall ecosystem growth.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-bitcoin-burials",
    "Body": "## History of Bitcoin Burials\n\nEvery time the media or some public figure has declared that Bitcoin is over, they‚Äôve fueled the fire that underpins Bitcoin Burials. It‚Äôs no secret that crypto has hit speed bumps over the last 15 years; but where naysayers saw doom, crypto believers have seen opportunity. The Burials founders are no exception. As one of the founders, Cadel,[previously told Leather](https://leather.io/blog/celebrating-bitcoin-s-resilience-with-bitcoin-burials), ‚ÄúThe impetus behind Burials was our desire to inscribe every time some clueless pundit, economist, politician, banker or the media at-large declared Bitcoin dead.‚Äù\n\nThe collection is full of historical references to roadblocks Bitcoin has overcome, cheekily honoring the token for its resilience. As Cadel stated, ‚Äúwhat better way to immortalize‚Äù the bad punditry surrounding Bitcoin than to store it on the very chain that they were attacking?\n\nThey were also inspired by the development of the Ordinals protocol, which[they believe](https://bitcoinburials.substack.com/p/funeralfriday-is-upon-us)changed the game as ‚Äúthere are no smart contracts, no deployers, no proxy contracts, no Owner functions, no concept of ‚Äúpauseability‚Äù [and] ‚Äúmetadata lock/freeze functions.‚Äù\n\nConcept Behind Bitcoin Burials\n\n## Concept Behind Bitcoin Burials\n\nKnowing the impetus behind the collection explains a lot about the artistic choices ‚Äî pixel-art style tombstones with BTC logos. The collection shares the same artist as[Bitcoin Frogs](https://leather.io/blog/guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-bitcoin-frogs), a veteran of the crypto and Ordinals space. (Interestingly, that‚Äôs not the only commonality between Burials and Frogs. They were also both launched on[Deezy](https://x.com/BitcoinBurials/status/1673734207812648987).) But in addition to cosmetic decisions, the art also features 400 unique dates that have been inscribed to the headstones. These dates were curated by the crew of[99bitcoins](https://99bitcoins.com/)who have kept careful track over the years of their archive of obituaries for Bitcoin from across the internet.\n\nMany of the other dates feature callbacks to prominent events, but they have the added benefit of providing a goal for collectors. Maybe there‚Äôs a notable date in their life ‚Äì or a particular memory they have associated with a date. This allows them to go hunting, so to speak, for a Burial featuring that date and adds an element of personalization to the collection.\n\nAdditionally, all Burials have a[CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/), which allows holders to retain ownership of their inscription and to use it as they see fit. This includes derivative works and commercial uses, allowing holders to truly retain the rights to their asset.\n\nDevelopment of Bitcoin Burials\n\n## Development of Bitcoin Burials\n\nBitcoin Burials is notable for its tech, being the first 10K Ordinal collection to store metadata inside the image itself ‚Äì on-chain metadata. They were able to do this by[repurposing the old Web2 standard](https://bitcoinburials.com/faq)known as EXIF data and embedding it directly into the images themselves. While this may seem like a small thing to those without significant technical knowledge, it provides plenty of opportunities for holders. This embedding unlocks numerous use cases and creates prime opportunities for a truly trustless, decentralized system ‚Äì in contrast to many NFT collections, which have data stored off-chain.\n\nThis crux comes down to trust. The Burials leadership felt that too many NFTs‚Äô data could be manipulated or deleted at-will by their creators, and that only those collectors with advanced technical knowledge would be able to differentiate between those with and without such pitfalls. That‚Äôs not the case with Ordinals, where all the art is on-chain.\n\nAs[they said to Leather](https://leather.io/blog/celebrating-bitcoin-s-resilience-with-bitcoin-burials)in March, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to trust us in any way, shape or form. Heck, you don‚Äôt even need to rely on our continued existence. We can get hacked, we can stop paying bills for critical infrastructure or simply disappear ‚Äì not that we ever would ‚Äì and our collectors will still be able to fully enjoy the collection for as long as Bitcoin itself keeps ticking along.‚Äù\n\nProjects Associated with Bitcoin Burials\n\n## Projects Associated with Bitcoin Burials\n\nBurials isn‚Äôt the only collection overseen by the founders of Bitcoin Burials. Earlier this year, they launched Boneys ‚Äì a[related 10K collection](https://www.runeslegacy.com/project/bitcoinburials)of ‚Äúplayful, mischievous skeletons, arising from the very criticisms that sought to bury Bitcoin.‚Äù Boneys can be paired with a holder‚Äôs Burial to incorporate rune mining, and ‚Äúpairs with rare traits or where the Boney emerged from its specific corresponding Burial enhance mining multipliers.‚Äù\n\nBoneys were offered as a[free](https://x.com/BitcoinBurials/status/1755990250340429928)mint to Burials holders, one of many examples of the collection providing rewards to holders. They also do biweekly giveaways, snapshotting the holders and allocating entries based on the number of PFPs held from the collection.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-prometheans",
    "Body": "## History of Prometheans & Associated Projects\n\nSo how did Prometheans come about? First and foremost, it‚Äôs in the CyberKongz DNA to arrive on the scene early with an innovative project. Their ETH-based $BANANA token was a pioneer in the NFT landscape more than[three years ago](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1780597357333127406). The CyberKongz group also think of themselves as ‚Äúchain-agnostic,‚Äù pseudonymous founding member Henry the Grape[told Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/228112/cyberkongz-reveal-bitcoin-runes-airdrop-details)in an interview. ‚ÄúWe knew it was going to be a mad rush, but we wanted to get an early Rune that aligned with provenance and culture.‚Äù Combine these two ideologies, and the debut of the Runes Protocol is an appealing opportunity.\n\nBut fundamentally, the collection was developed to allow CyberKongz to enter the Bitcoin ecosystem in a way that[respects](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1784568898127269977)the builders who have spent so long working to expand the chain and its use cases. Prometheans was specifically designed to achieve this goal by taking holders along with them for the ride. Twenty prominent Ordinals communities were chosen to receive airdrops, among others. (A smaller percentage was earmarked for CyberKongz holders.)\n\nAs the Prometheans‚Äô founders[explained](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1780597357333127406), they focused on selecting individuals ‚Äúthat have pioneered the journey of Ordinals thus far. The ones who dared to carve their own path and shape the history of Ordinals, even in the face of skepticism and doubt.‚Äù This ensures that the collection encompasses not just the core values of the CyberKongz team (‚Äú[innovation, experimentation, and pioneering](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1784568898127269977)‚Äù), but also the unique culture that underpins the Bitcoin community.\n\nConcept Behind Prometheans\n\n## Concept Behind Prometheans\n\nThe Prometheans artwork is recognizable by its crop-circle-like appearance, surrounded by a rotating wheel. The collection colors are fiery; every PFP is made up of vivid reds, oranges and yellows. The entire image almost appears to be a satellite, or a clock. This was an intentional choice; the collection is[meant to evoke](https://app.mintify.xyz/collection/prometheans-by-cyberkongz/)‚Äúthe essence of time itself.‚Äù\n\nTons of thought went into creating the collection‚Äôs aesthetic. The clocklike structure was a sartorial choice, while the front layer of hexagons in the artwork was crafted according to the Golden Ratio. As the creators[wrote](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1778893548403716606), ‚ÄúAs Satoshi Nakamoto pointed out, Bitcoin is fundamentally a clock, a concept visually echoed in the Prometheans artwork. The outer layers mimic the pendulum of a grandfather clock. The centerpiece, with its intricate gearwork, symbolizes the relentless passage of time, much like the blocks of Bitcoin marking each moment in its own continuum.‚Äù\n\nThe motifs in Prometheans are at the very least Bitcoin-adjacent, if not direct callouts to historical and culturally significant moments in the chain‚Äôs history. At the center of the art is a bright sphere,[designed to reference](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1778893661477961985)the pivotal introduction of decentralized finance to society. The collection also features letters from the Niakean alphabet, which was created by Myoo. It‚Äôs not just appearance, either. As of its inscription, it was the 7th largest file that had ever been inscribed on Bitcoin, representing a landmark in web3 development.\n\nDevelopment of Prometheans\n\n## Development of Prometheans\n\nThe CyberKongz crew placed a great deal of emphasis on the idea that Prometheans should welcome those who have previously been focused on other chains. To that end, they developed a Diamond Hand Weighting system (in partnership with Ordinals Bot). With this mechanism, it was decided that 85% of the 21,000 Prometheans would be airdropped to existing, prominent Ordinals communities. The other 15% was specifically earmarked for CyberKongz holders to thank them for their loyalty.\n\nThis system ensured that the users who are most invested in the Ordinals space ‚Äì and especially those who are recognized for their work in the field ‚Äì are rewarded for their ‚ÄòDiamond Hands.‚Äô Since the collection‚Äôs debut in April, CyberKongz has been able to onboard more than 1200 of their existing holders into the Ordinals space.\n\nBut if you had qualified for an inscription, you'd have gotten one. As a free mint, the barrier to entry was community-based. As[the founders emphasized](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1780597357333127406), \"No extraction. No cash grab. No bullshit. Just respect for what has been built on BTC before us.\" By focusing on the finer details, the Prometheans team has been able to build their own technical achievements and create a collection that is long-lasting.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is a Bitcoin Builder?\n\nNormally when people inside the Bitcoin ecosystem speak about ‚Äòbuilders,‚Äô they‚Äôre referring to developers; software engineers who are creating products on the Bitcoin network like decentralized applications (dApps) such as wallets, trading platforms, and beyond. However, as the ecosystem widens and the verticals that Bitcoin operates in expand, so does the definition of a builder.\n\nThat knowledge is helping teams like Velar build their roadmap toward greater inclusivity and reach for Bitcoin. As Watson notes, one of the most important types of builders are those that buy, hold, and plan to pass down to their grandchildren in the future. These are the types builders who have been around from Bitcoin‚Äôs infancy. These HODLers have existed ever since Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs seminal whitepaper, patiently stacking sats and slowly building generational wealth. Slowly but surely, they‚Äôve also become the evangelists who have inspired so many others to join the broader community.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/477347aa7a769495eb1add20261d9170.png)\n\nThat, in turn, has inspired others.\n\n‚ÄúThis is not a short-term plan,‚Äù says Watson. ‚ÄúThis is not a one-cycle play. This is not a one-year quick thing. This is something that we want to be building for all of eternity.‚Äù\n\nBringing More Builders to Bitcoin\n\n## Bringing More Builders to Bitcoin\n\nIn recent years, NFTs have entered the mainstream zeitgeist, following crypto as a whole. Even more recently, Ordinals have expanded Bitcoin‚Äôs reach into multimedia projects as the concept of immutable proof of ownership in the digital world has grown into maturity. This, at its core, is a great opportunity to bring the digital-native world into the Bitcoin community.\n\nThrough the explosion in popularity of NFTs and Ordinals multimedia, artists from across the globe have realized the value that Web3 holds, and have begun using their ambition and creative output to make their mark on Bitcoin. Marketplaces like Magic Eden have already seen millions of dollars in NFT value created on the Bitcoin network as artists and those who seek to support them realize the potential of the space. Many of those artists and patrons learned about Bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, from sources other than Bitcoin itself. Many got their start in Ethereum, and many others began by chasing the thrill of memecoins ‚Äì something that Watson says should not be discounted.\n\n‚ÄúI believe memecoins bring the users. So if someone really wants a memecoin, they‚Äôre going to onboard with a Leather wallet, they're going to come to Velar, they're going to buy it, we've got a new user from the memecoin,\" says Watson. \"But the second reason is, most entrepreneurs and builders who haven't got the technical or technological aspect to build something, they're going to start with the memecoin first, then they're going to get involved with the community, then they're probably going to have an idea, then they're going to meet a dev from the community.\"\n\n\"Next thing, they‚Äôre building an actual real [use] case project.‚Äù\n\nThis gets to the heart of Velar‚Äôs focus on inclusivity and community in pursuit of bringing more people to Bitcoin. The definition of a Bitcoin builder will continue to change primarily as awareness of crypto as a tool is spread. The more functions that tool can serve, the more prospective users are turned into avid users, and the deeper their involvement in building the next phase of the broader paradigm becomes.\n\nIf Bitcoin‚Äôs history proves anything, it‚Äôs that sustained growth and proliferation do not happen overnight, nor do they happen linearly. Sources of real, lasting growth ‚Äì new developers with breakthrough infrastructural ideas, sources of influence that garner mainstream attention, and beyond ‚Äì often come from outside of the established community to help bolster the existing ecosystem.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## The Untapped Potential of Bitcoin\n\nIn October 2024, the market valuation of BTC surpassed $1.35 trillion, according to[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), and surpassed silver to become the 8th most valuable property.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin enjoys unparalleled dominance over other cryptocurrencies, it remained underutilised and unproductive in user wallets. Bitcoin‚Äôs enormous liquidity reserves stayed dormant due to the network‚Äôs restricted scalability. Additionally, the Bitcoin network doesn‚Äôt natively support programmable smart contracts and has a delayed block confirmation time.\n\nThese problems affected financial activity on Bitcoin and hindered the growth of BTC-based decentralized finance. However, in the absence of[Bitcoin DeFi](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-bitcoin-defi), it will never be possible to build an alternative to legacy financial systems through Bitcoin.\n\n### Making Bitcoin more suitable for DeFi\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/d0109514d5103c869275254937621681.png)\n\nDevelopers within the Bitcoin community have been working for a long time to improve Bitcoin‚Äôs functionality and performance. The aim was to make Bitcoin more suitable for DeFi and empower users to capitalize on their vast BTC reserves.\n\nFor example, Casey Rodarmor‚Äôs launch of[Ordinals](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals)in January 2023 and[Runes Protocol](https://leather.io/blog/bitcoin-runes-have-come-to-leather-unpacking-the-runes-protocol)in 2024 have introduced NFT-like inscriptions and fungible meme coins on Bitcoin. These tokens have helped developers experiment with a number of possible DeFi-related use cases.\n\nSimilarly, the launch of Bitcoin Layer 2 networks like Stacks has opened up new avenues in Bitcoin finance. Stacks offers smart contract functionality to Bitcoin and the recent Nakamoto upgrade reduces transaction processing time to 5 seconds with immediate transaction confirmation.\n\nLayer 2 networks like Stacks empower developers to create applications that make Bitcoin a more versatile asset class. These apps enable users to leverage BTC in multiple ways. For instance, anyone can use BTC as a collateral to borrow other crypto or as a digital asset that can earn yield.\n\nHow Stacks Contributes to Bitcoin DeFi\n\n## How Stacks Contributes to Bitcoin DeFi\n\nStacks provides a platform with much of the programmability needed to[unlock DeFi capabilities](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-stacks)for Bitcoin developers and users. It has opened up the space for unprecedented development and user adoption, making Bitcoin Layer2s a strong competitor of Ethereum Layer 2s.\n\nBitcoin L2s like Stacks have the potential to address the surging market appetite, trading volumes, and emerging user expectations. Stacks provides a sustainable ecosystem to bolster Bitcoin‚Äôs use cases and help[drive innovation in Bitcoin DeFi](https://leather.io/blog/how-to-bring-more-builders-to-bitcoin-defi).\n\nA lot of the activity on Bitcoin is powered by Stacks-based protocols and tokens like ALEX, Velar, STX City, and other projects.\n\nHow Stacks Projects Contribute to Bitcoin DeFi\n\n## How Stacks Projects Contribute to Bitcoin DeFi\n\nALEX is one of the most successful projects on Stacks that facilitates the creation of a finance layer on Bitcoin. The ALEX protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of over $158 million with over $2 billion in total transaction volume across 66K active wallets.\n\nThe[ALEX](https://alexgo.io/)DeFi ecosystem provides the following decentralized applications (dapps):\n\n- SWAP- It is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that leverages automated market makers (AMMs) for seamless token swaps.\n- KICKSTART- It is a launchpad that provides the necessary tools to kickstart new projects within the Bitcoin space.\n- LISA- It offers Bitcoin liquid staking options to maximize yield from idle BTC assets.\n- TRADE B20- It is a trading platform for BRC-20 and SIP-10 tokens with optimal price discovery mechanisms.\n- XLINK- It is a Bitcoin bridge that connects various blockchains to ensure smooth asset transfers.\nVelar is another popular Stacks protocol for unlocking Bitcoin‚Äôs liquidity through swapping, trading, and launching digital assets. The[Velar](https://velar.com/)ecosystem offers the following dapps:\n\n- Velar DEX- The DEX enables users to swap tokens with minimal fees.\n- Perpetual DEX- It enables traders to trade crypto with 20x leverage, ensuring more security for users.\n- Memestacker- It allows users to launch memecoins on the Bitcoin network without any fees.\n- Velar Bridge- It facilitates interoperability and bridges assets across different ecosystems.\n- Velar Launchpad- The launchpad is coming soon and it will help projects start their operations on Bitcoin.\nSimilarly,[STX City](https://stx.city/bonding-curve)is another project that empowers users to launch memecoins in a few seconds without any prior coding knowledge. It also supports Bonding Curve tokens. These are some of the projects that are taking Bitcoin DeFi to the next level.\n\nUnlocking Bitcoin DeFi‚Äôs Potential\n\n## Unlocking Bitcoin DeFi‚Äôs Potential\n\nA[Spartan Research report](https://bitcoinlayersreport.com/)states that Bitcoin DeFi offers a 7-fold growth opportunity without considering any additional liquidity influx. To better understand the point, let us closely look at the report‚Äôs statistics.\n\nIn December 2023, BTC‚Äôs market cap was $850 billion, 3.1 times more than Ethereum‚Äôs $270 billion. But, Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi TVL was $76 billion or 28% of its market cap compared to merely $320 million for Bitcoin DeFi.\n\nKeeping the data points constant, Bitcoin DeFi offers a $238 billion market opportunity as of December 2023. These figures don‚Äôt consider any surge in user adoption or influx of new capital.\n\nNeedless to say, as BTC prices hit new highs, the potential for Bitcoin DeFi will keep expanding. To this end, Bitcoin Layer 2s like Stacks and Stacks-based protocols will play a significant role in contributing to Bitcoin DeFi.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What is Digital Matter Theory (DMT)?\n\nDigital Matter Theory (DMT) represents a fascinating aspect of blockchain technology. Historically significant for Bitcoin, DMT involves recognizing and utilizing patterns in blockchain data to create digital substances. Unlike traditional inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, DMT saves metadata and algorithms rather than entire files, allowing for the real-time generation of digital assets.\n\nThe concept of DMT can be likened to finding patterns in nature and creating new substances from these patterns. In the context of Bitcoin, users discovered patterns in Bitcoin block data that could be harnessed to create digital substances. DMT provides a way to conceptualize and understand the substance and significance of digital tokens beyond their mere representation of value. Once recognized and utilized, these patterns can lead to the generation of a new form of digital material that behaves like physical matter, despite lacking a tangible presence.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ee527a8ddf6c75c4504d6efef0ac987d.png)\n\nMany see[Ordinals](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals),[Rare Sats](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-rare-sats), and Bitmap theory as early applications of DMT. Ordinals, introduced by Casey Rodarmor, assign numismatic value to satoshis, enabling their collection and trade as digital artifacts. Rare Sats build on Ordinals, positioning uniquely placed satoshis on the blockchain as rare collectibles. Bitmap theory, proposed by Bitoshi Blockamoto, treats each block as digital real estate, creating a non-arbitrary metaverse.\n\nHowever, according to the creators of Stacks Invaders, there are differences between DMT and Ordinals.\n\nDMT vs. Ordinals: What's the Difference?\n\n## DMT vs. Ordinals: What's the Difference?\n\nIn a recent Twitter space hosted by Leather, Ian, one of the creators of Stacks Invaders, explained the differences between DMT and Ordinals. While both involve on-chain inscriptions, Ordinals save the entire file directly onto the blockchain. In contrast, DMT saves a JSON file containing details related to the mint, which are then used to generate the image in real-time. This approach allows for more efficient use of blockchain space and offers a new way to create and interact with digital assets.\n\n\"For Stacks Invaders, we use a smart contract to identify the block and generate the image in real time. If you visit the Stacks Invaders website and click the 'Preview Next Invader' button, you can see the image generated for the current Stacks block that people will be competing for. This process calls a Stacks smart contract, retrieves the image as an SVG file, and saves it to your machine. It's that simple and pretty cool!\" said Ian.\n\nAnother way to understand the difference is that Ordinals can save any file on-chain by converting it to binary and embedding it into the blockchain. This method allows for a wide range of files to be inscribed, from images to text files, but it consumes significant block space. On the other hand, DMT focuses on storing metadata and algorithms, which are much smaller and can be used to generate digital assets dynamically. This makes DMT a more scalable and efficient method for creating on-chain digital assets.\n\nStacks Invaders Work?\n\n## Stacks Invaders Work?\n\nWith each new Stacks block, an art piece is generated, meaning only one Stacks Invader can be minted per block. This results in a slow, strategic minting process where patience is rewarded. The collection consists of 4,995 pieces, and if a new NFT is minted every 10 minutes (the average time for a new Stacks block), it would take approximately 34 days for the entire collection to mint out.\n\nThe art generation process involves using data from the block itself. For instance, the last two digits of the block number determine the color of the art, while other digits define the pattern and elements of the artwork. This method ensures each piece is unique and tied directly to the blockchain data, making it impossible to manipulate or predict the outcome.\n\nTo mint a Stacks Invader, users simply connect their Leather wallet to the Stacks Invaders website and press the \"Mint\" button. Due to the competitive nature of the minting process, users must be strategic and patient. It's important to note that only one NFT can be minted per block, so trying to mint multiple times within one block is not advisable and could result in wasted transaction fees.\n\nEven though Jack and Ian came up with the Stacks Invaders idea, it is a community-built and maintained project. The aim is to engage the community and foster a collaborative environment where users can explore and build upon the project's foundations.\n\nConclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Stacks Invaders project is not just another generative collection; it‚Äôs a pioneering effort that could reshape the future of digital art. It not only showcases the capabilities of the Stacks blockchain but also exemplifies the innovative use of Digital Matter Theory.\n\nBy combining on-chain generative art with DMT principles, the creators have set a new standard for NFTs on Stacks. Moreover, the project highlights the potential for creating digital substances using blockchain data patterns, offering a new and exciting way to conceptualize and interact with digital assets.\n\nStacks Invaders is a reflection of the immense creativity and innovation within the blockchain space, paving the way for future developments in the world of NFTs and digital art. It will be exciting to see how the community embraces and builds upon these groundbreaking concepts.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## The Concept Behind Honey Badgers\n\nThe honey badgers art is ‚Äì as its name implies ‚Äì full of badgers with unique characteristics to distinguish them from one another. The honey badgers come in different colors, each have special traits and are meant to represent the fearless spirit of the Bitcoin ecosystem and community. Artist Rodrigo hoped the pixelated art style would evoke nostalgia,[writing](https://twitter.com/DesenhistaRedn/status/1628511579430961153)on X that pixel art always reminds him of ‚Äúthe dream [he] had as a kid of making [his] own video game.‚Äù This led him to design the badgers in full body poses so he could incorporate action shots. Many of the other artistic choices came from community members, who suggested specific traits for various badgers.\n\nBut the broader choice to use honey badgers as a name and concept requires a bit more explanation to fully understand. The whole thing starts with a viral 2011 YouTube video called ‚ÄúThe Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger (original narration by Randall).‚Äù The video features documentary-style wildlife footage of honey badgers hunting jackals and eating cobras while a narrator fires off chaotic lines like ‚Äúhoney badger don't care‚Äù and ‚Äúhoney badger don‚Äôt give a shit.‚Äù\n\nThe honey badger (and its general lack of shits given) ultimately became a popular meme among Bitcoiners, who compared the animal to the cryptocurrency for both being fearless and persistent. Adding to the lore was Roger Ver, an early promoter in the Bitcoin ecosystem, who at one point was paying for a billboard Bitcoin ad on the Santa Clara Lawrence Expressway that[featured the words](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-is-called-honey-badger), ‚ÄúThe Honey Badger of Money.‚Äù\n\nThe History of Honey Badgers\n\n## The History of Honey Badgers\n\nAkva got his start in Ordinals early, after learning about the theory in a Stacks layer community post just after the protocol launched. He was excited by the energy and ambition of these open-minded Bitcoiners, but found himself[initially disappointed](https://defire.money/ordinal-honey-badgers/)with the creativity of the earliest collections. Akva felt that many of the first projects were copies of those developed on other blockchain platforms.\n\nThis inspired him to step up and develop his own Bitcoin-native project. The collection has been[described](https://honeybadgers.btcmint.app/)as ‚Äúan experiment to see if a native NFT community can emerge and thrive on the native Bitcoin ecosystem.‚Äù The founders wanted to prove wrong the Bitcoin maximalists who believe that Bitcoin should only serve as a currency and should not focus on developing other use cases.\n\nAccording to Akva, the goal of the Honey Badgers was to build something that was fun, original and (most importantly) affordable. Akva turned to a longtime friend of his ‚Äì Rodrigo ‚Äì to build alongside him. It took just a shockingly short five days from the concept being born to them beginning their mint.¬†p\n\nThe Development of Honey Badgers\n\n## The Development of Honey Badgers\n\nAs noted earlier, Honey Badgers has one of[several claims](https://blog.ordinalhub.com/the-first-10k-ordinals-breakdown/)to the title of first ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù 10K collection. The controversy is this: Honey Badgers started inscribing at #81,557 and were the first such collection to begin. However, they did not finish minting out until #1,029,518 ‚Äì roughly two months later. Because NodeMonkes completed their inscriptions ‚Äúfirst,‚Äù many consider them to be the first 10K collection. Some members of the Honey Badgers community contest this viewpoint, highlighting that Bitcoin itself is not done being mined and that doesn‚Äôt stop people from considering it the first chain.\n\nThe mint itself was highly affordable,[costing 69420 satoshis](https://twitter.com/HoneyBadgersBtc/status/1762342317225021764)(for the lulz) and gas fees. With those fees, it was roughly 0.001 BTC, which equated at that time to roughly $22 USD. Each minter received a 1-1 airdrop, bringing the net effective price to $11 USD.\n\nBecause the collection was so early into Ordinals, there wasn‚Äôt really a wealth of processes available for their launch. They utilized a unique minting process through Lightning, with help from Deezy‚Äôs[@dannyndiekroeger.](https://x.com/dannydiekroeger)There are no roadmaps for Honey Badgers, and no promised utility. Its sole stated purpose is to provide a place for the community to gather and a symbol of the resilience that underpins crypto culture. All metadata in the collection lives on-chain.\n\nTo judge the financial success of the collection, you need look no further than inscription number[eight](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/item-details/d95c0fb86bc0f0dce6a732c5ab77d47e33ed24099bdb01133f768cef75a47724i0), which[sold in December 2023](https://x.com/MEonBTC/status/1732882916219183256?s=20)for a record 10.4 BTC. This sale, and the continuing resilience of the community, proves the Honey Badgers collection‚Äôs staying power.\n\nnan\n\n",

This means that Leather users can now see the following tokens in USD:\n\n- BTC\n- STX\n- SIP-10\n- BRC-20\n- Runes\nWe first[introduced USD balance displays for a number of tokens in April](https://leather.io/blog/giving-users-the-best-bitcoin-wallet-balance-displays-usd-balances-in-leather)to give users immediate clarity on their portfolio‚Äôs value, eliminating the need for additional tools or calculations. This feature is crucial for several reasons:\n\n- **Help with informed decision-making:**When users can easily see the value of their assets in USD, they can make more informed decisions regarding buying, selling, and other transactions with their tokens. This transparency allows for better planning and decision-making when users put their Bitcoin-backed tokens to use.\n- **Improved user experience:**Managing digital currencies can be complex. By displaying balances in USD, we‚Äôre simplifying the process and making token management more intuitive and user-friendly. This helps prevent common issues such as overdrawing funds or misinterpreting transaction values, which can be discouraging for users and deter them from engaging with their Bitcoin wallet and, subsequently, the Bitcoin ecosystem at large.\nImproving Our UI for Balances and Collectibles\n\n## Improving Our UI for Balances and Collectibles\n\nVersion 6.44.0 also introduced additional UI fixes, including:\n\n- An STX balance loader fix\n- Ordinal inscription displays\nThese updates are part of our ongoing efforts to streamline how users interact with Leather to give them a Bitcoin wallet extension that is as efficient and enjoyable as possible.\n\nBuilding the Best Bitcoin Wallet Experience\n\n## Building the Best Bitcoin Wallet Experience\n\nWe‚Äôre committed to providing our users with the best Bitcoin wallet experience for managing their Bitcoin-backed digital assets. The introduction of USD balance displays for Runes is just another step in our efforts to build clarity and confidence for users from the moment they open their Leather wallet.\n\nWe believe this feature, along with our most recent UI improvements, speaks to how even small changes can significantly add to a Bitcoin user‚Äôs wallet experience. This, in turn, is crucial for encouraging users to explore the wider Bitcoin ecosystem and discover all the ways they can make their Bitcoin productive.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Improving Bitcoin Wallet UI/UX: Key Points From the Bitcoin Conference Week\n\nOur week in Nashville strongly reinforced one thing: there is still a significant difference between user-friendly experiences tailored for web3 natives and those designed for the general public. While early adopters and crypto enthusiasts may be accustomed to clunky UI/UX and confusing troubleshooting, it's crucial to prioritize seamless, intuitive user experiences that cater to everyone, not just the tech-savvy.\n\nThis was a consistent theme in our conversations with crypto users during a number of Leather-sponsored events. Our brunch at Ord House, along with our involvement at Bit Gala and Bitcoining on Broadway, gave us the opportunity to connect with a diverse group of users, many of whom emphasized the need for general wallet UI/UX improvements. Experienced crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike are eager to find a reliable wallet that fully enables them to explore new dApps on Bitcoin.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1eb0d8c8b4b4e2341402f7cbf89c8dd0.png)\n\nThe reality is that in today‚Äôs growing Bitcoin ecosystem, users need a unified and straightforward wallet experience. Over the years, Leather has addressed this head-on by integrating everything from[Native SegWit inscription support](https://leather.io/blog/native-segwit-inscriptions-support-goes-live-on-leather)to[fiat displays for users‚Äô tokens](https://leather.io/blog/see-your-runes-in-usd-with-leather). A Bitcoin address type shouldn‚Äôt hinder users‚Äô ability to buy, send, receive, and swap tokens and collectibles, nor should users be forced to calculate token values on their own.\n\nWhile these barriers may seem minor to seasoned crypto users, they can significantly discourage the crypto-curious from fully embracing web3 and blockchain. Trust Machines COO Rena Shah[described it best when she stated that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH6K-4yGOVo), ‚ÄúWe want [Leather] to feel like the experience of using a Venmo, or the experience of being in Twitter.‚Äù Bitcoin wallets should be as easy to navigate as the consumer apps you use every day, and that's exactly what Leather is looking to achieve\n\nBalancing Innovation and Ease-of-Use for Bitcoin Wallets\n\n## Balancing Innovation and Ease-of-Use for Bitcoin Wallets\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2bb288f0ac57bac5283ee629eee68966.jpeg)\n\nBut truthfully, navigating and managing crypto wallets can be overwhelming, even for experienced users. Supporting users on a daily basis is critical, and that includes dealing with the cumbersome steps required to interact with the latest innovations. Our general manager, Mark Hendrickson, has long emphasized that while innovation is essential, a user-friendly interface that prioritizes accessibility and security should be the foundation of any wallet.\n\nSupporting cutting-edge features shouldn‚Äôt come at the expense of offering clear, straightforward access to transactions and account information. These UI/UX upgrades are vital for the success of wallets like Leather in the next phase of web3.\n\nThis is especially important as Bitcoin builders seek to introduce new technologies and improve upon existing protocols. Inscribing Nashville, for instance, united many of the most prominent developers and artists for in-depth explorations on how to further develop the Ordinals protocol and build more use cases for on-chain data preservation. While these conversations reveal the vast number of projects and protocols being built, wallets need to be intentional when it comes to[integrating these new technologies](https://leather.io/blog/july-partnerships-roundup-more-avenues-for-rare-sats)for users.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a balance that you need to kind of strike between immediately supporting every new thing that‚Äôs coming out and being much more thoughtful about what you want to support,‚Äù our social media manager, Brandon Marshall, emphasized during a panel at Ord House. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, not everything is going to be successful, so you might waste engineering resources supporting this new protocol that doesn‚Äôt exist in a few months.‚Äù\n\nThe growing prominence of[Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) solutions](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-layers-world-of-bitcoin-layer-2)will also be highly significant for crypto users in the coming years. Our team spoke at length about the unique role Bitcoin wallets will play as L2s like Stacks continue to evolve and enable more decentralized applications (dApps) on Bitcoin. As more dApps are built on Bitcoin, it is crucial for wallets to provide user-friendly interfaces that serve as viable gateways to these applications. Without these interfaces, users may be deterred from exploring new innovations because the process of doing so is just too tedious.\n\nWhat‚Äôs Next For Leather?\n\n## What‚Äôs Next For Leather?\n\nIn short, our week in Nashville reaffirmed that an intuitive, user-friendly wallet is essential for onboarding more people into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Removing barriers to entry is key for the next generation of Bitcoin users, and it all begins with their Bitcoin wallet.\n\nBy prioritizing seamless and accessible interfaces, we aim to make managing Bitcoin-backed assets as effortless as using any other consumer app. This commitment extends to both our browser extension and our upcoming mobile app, which is currently in development.\n\nWe believe that improving the Bitcoin wallet user experience is essential for driving broader adoption of Bitcoin, enabling everyone to confidently navigate the world‚Äôs oldest blockchain.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Welshcorgicoin - An Overview\n\nWelshcorgicoin was launched on[November 24, 2021](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x51a1069fc2b9ed446136a5bacff92710fa42206893ace3d9d423337f50e1e355?chain=mainnet), making it one of the earliest Bitcoin-linked memecoins. This quirky dog-themed coin is deployed on the Stacks blockchain, a layer 2 network that enhances the Bitcoin blockchain's capabilities. Stacks uses its native token, STX, for transaction fees and staking rewards in Bitcoin, securing a dominant position as the[leading Bitcoin Layer 2](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stacks)solution with a market cap of $2.3 billion.\n\nIn contrast,[Welshcorgicoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/welsh-corgi-coin)has a total supply of 10 billion tokens and market capitalization of $24.5 million.\n\nThe Community Takeover\n\n## The Community Takeover\n\nAfter the launch of $WELSH, the original developers stepped back, and the community stepped up to take control of the project. This phenomenon, known as a community takeover (CTO), occurs when developers abandon a project, leaving its fate in the hands of token holders and supporters. The $WELSH community exemplifies this spirit of resilience and dedication.\n\nThree key aspects define a successful CTO: a strong community, pooled resources, and success stories. A strong community is essential, driven by a desire to save the project and protect their investments. The $WELSH community has shown remarkable motivation and organization, with an active presence on social media, particularly their X (formerly Twitter) page[@welsh_community](https://x.com/Welsh_Community), which boasts 14.7k followers. Their efforts have also led to the listing of $WELSH on several centralized exchanges like MEXC, CoinEX, and BitMart, making the token more accessible to non-crypto-native users.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/5aacdba6dd69019802576c68dd4f0344.png)\n\nWELSH Ecosystem\n\n## WELSH Ecosystem\n\nThe $WELSH ecosystem thrives on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's security to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As the community aptly puts it, ‚ÄúBitcoin, the OG of crypto, is stepping up, opening its doors wide to DeFi.‚Äù This shift underscores the potential of using DeFi on the most secure network available.\n\n$WELSH can be traded on various decentralized exchanges or used to provide liquidity. STX/WELSH liquidity pools are active on platforms like[Alexlab](https://app.alexlab.co/pool),[Velar](https://app.velar.co/pool), and[Arkadiko](https://info.arkadiko.finance/), offering $WELSH holders the opportunity to earn interest on their capital. This ecosystem not only supports trading but also educates users on important DeFi components like liquidity provision, blockchain, and wallet usage, contributing to the broader development of the Stacks network.\n\nAdding to its vibrant ecosystem, the Welshcorgicoin community has launched an NFT collection called[Happy Welsh](https://stacks.gamma.io/collections/happy-welsh), available on Gamma, Stacks‚Äô native NFT trading platform. This collection features 2,000 unique items, with a current floor price of 47 STX and 791 unique owners. The limited number of listed items indicates a strong community commitment to holding these NFTs, reflecting the project's growing value and engagement.\n\nThe Role of Communities in Bitcoin Education\n\n## The Role of Communities in Bitcoin Education\n\nWelshcorgicoin‚Äôs journey from a playful memecoin to a robust, community-driven project highlights the dynamic potential of cryptocurrencies. Thanks to the dedication and collaboration of its community, $WELSH has flourished, creating a vibrant ecosystem that supports DeFi applications, NFT trading, and more. While investing in memecoins like $WELSH comes with inherent risks, the story of Welshcorgicoin demonstrates the power of community in driving innovation and growth in the crypto space.\n\nIf you're looking to explore more of the Bitcoin and Stacks ecosystem, Welshcorgicoin offers a captivating and educational look into the future of community-led cryptocurrency projects.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-frucks",
    "Body": "## History & Concept Behind Frucks\n\nDespite their small team size, the Frucks creators have excelled at marketing the collection through social media, in part because they are all familiar faces in the crypto space. The founders are each team members of the Ethereum-based Kaiju Kingz NFT project (among other groups), and they‚Äôre well-known in the web3 community. But they are also a Twitter-native bunch, with their community highly focused on the site. Unlike many projects, there‚Äôs no group Discord for Frucks.\n\nThe premise of Frucks is ‚Äì at its core ‚Äì pretty simple. As founder Sam[wrote on X](https://x.com/supremelabs_io/status/1803992262902513835), ‚ÄúFrucks was designed to do simple things right. Low entry, realistic speculative utility, and spreading good intent across web3.‚Äù This much is clear from their tweets, which focus heavily on positivity and promoting collaborations with other collections.\n\nTo that end, the main character of their artwork, Frucky, was ‚Äú[created to be a community adoptable character](https://x.com/supremelabs_io/status/1803992262902513835)- used to lower the guards we all artificially put up.‚Äù As one of the founders[stated](https://x.com/supremelabs_io/status/1796207640726704528), ‚ÄúWe just like frogs and bitcoin.‚Äù Looking at the collection, that much is very clear. The Frucks artwork is made up of various cartoon frogs, with different body colors, clothing and other traits. Each Frucky is set against an orange background and has a vaguely old-school feel to it. (Many of the Frucky features were animated by Walaa.) The collection‚Äôs website is no different. Designed to look like a Windows 98 desktop, the Fruck homepage is rife with 90s-era energy.\n\nDevelopment of Frucks\n\n## Development of Frucks\n\nNot much is currently known about the technical aspects of the PFPs or the funding behind the Frucks collection. As far as Ordinals collections go, Frucks is still in relative infancy. The collection itself ‚Äì and many of its milestones ‚Äì was announced through animated videos and posts targeting a very online, web3, meme-friendly culture. For example,[one such video](https://x.com/frucksBTC/status/1796210555084251494)that was published on mint day depicted the Frucks edited into the beginning of the anime ‚ÄúNeon Genesis Evangelion.‚Äù\n\nThese announcements have received plenty of viral attention online, and they‚Äôve had a demonstrated impact. Though[Sam](https://x.com/supremelabs_io/status/1796207640726704528)has said they did not pay to promote the project, it‚Äôs been a quick success. The 4.8K total supply was minted out on ME launchpad and sold out quickly.\n\nProjects Associated with Frucks\n\n## Projects Associated with Frucks\n\nNeedless to say, the Frucks team hasn‚Äôt been sitting idly. Recently, they airdropped their own Rune token (with the apropos ticker $WTF) into the wallets of Frucks holders who had previously been granted ‚Äúautomatic access‚Äù to the $WTF website. Leading up to the aidrop, users could find opportunities to earn more $WTF tokens through web games, including a racer game and slot game (among other options). A number of Magic Eden Runes addresses were also recipients of $WTF.\n\nAnd then there‚Äôs the collaborations. Frucks has a heavy culture of teaming up with other blockchain groups. A quick skim of their socials shows references to a[CyberKongz Kongmunity](https://x.com/CyberKongmunity/status/1803814768106491993)collab, as well partnerships with[Antisocial GG](https://x.com/Antisocial_GG/status/1807065936341459151)and[Playmaker DAO](https://x.com/PlaymakerDAO/status/1806789449801781504). And that‚Äôs just a sampler. Interest in teaming up with the Fruck pondfolk was so high that Brick by Brick host[@NFTBawsa](https://x.com/nftbawsa)has said in multiple Spaces events that he was getting DMs asking him how to partner with the group. Frucks themselves weighed in, creating[a form for their website](https://tally.so/r/wzzJd8)for potential collaborators to apply through and posting about it on X. While there is still much more to come as the Frucks project grows, it‚Äôs clear that their initial work has struck a chord within its community.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is Ordinal Lending?\n\nOrdinal lending is a process where you deposit Ordinals as collateral within a lending-borrowing protocol to take crypto loans.\n\nThe Ordinals remain locked in a contract until the borrower repays the loan and interest to the lender. If the borrower fails to repay and defaults on the loan, the collateralized Ordinal goes to the lender.\n\nOrdinal lending helps Ordinal owners borrow against their assets to unlock their liquidity without losing asset custody. Simultaneously, lenders can earn extra yields on their idle crypto assets by offering loans against collateralized Ordinals.\n\nThere are several types of Ordinal lending. Some protocols like[Arcade](https://www.arcade.xyz/)wrap the Ordinals to provide loans. Other protocols like[OrdinalDAO](https://twitter.com/the_ordinal_dao)which ultimately didn‚Äôt work, provided wrapped BTC called rBTC on the Bitcoin sidechain, Rootstock.\n\nHow Does Ordinal Lending Work?\n\n## How Does Ordinal Lending Work?\n\nDifferent Ordinal lending protocols work in different ways.\n\nFor instance, Arcade[wrapped](https://thedefiant.io/news/nfts-and-web3/ordinals-lending-market-heats-up-on-ethereum)a Nodemonke Ordinal into an Ethereum-based NFT and provided a 25 ETH loan worth $80,000. The loan term was for 60 days with a 55% annualized interest rate.\n\nOn the other hand, Liquidum is a P2P marketplace where users can borrow BTC against an Ordinal without wrapping them.\n\nThe MagicEden API provides a list of Ordinals on Liquidium. Borrowers can choose the asset they own from the available list and use it as collateral to avail of a loan.\n\nLiquidium‚Äôs lending-borrowing process occurs through Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) and Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs).\n\nThe DLC stores the Ordinal as collateral which remains inaccessible to borrowers and lenders during the loan term. DeepLake Oracles verifies on-chain activity to determine the loan outcome and sends the results to DLC after loan period termination.\n\nIf the borrower repays the loan plus interest, the DLC automatically executes using a PSBT to return the collateralized Ordinal to its owner. However, if the borrower fails to repay, the collateralized Ordinal goes to the lender.\n\nAs a P2P protocol, Liquidium facilitates lenders and borrowers to come together and mutually agree on the loan terms. Liquidium takes a 20% fee from the interest on the BTC loan for operational costs.\n\nThe Problem With Ordinal Lending Protocols\n\n## The Problem With Ordinal Lending Protocols\n\nOrdinal lending protocols like Arcade wrap Ordinals before transferring the tokens to a different blockchain. However, such token transfers involve additional fees and security vulnerabilities.\n\nLiquidium enables users to borrow BTC against their Ordinals without changing networks or transferring assets to different wallets. Moreover, Liquidium can leverage Bitcoin L1‚Äôs privacy and security to ensure the safety of the collateralized Ordinals.\n\nHowever, since Liquidium works on Stacks, it inherited the problems of the early iteration of the Layer 2 network.\n\nFor example, Stacks block production rate was linked to Bitcoin block production in a 1:1 ratio. Since it takes about 10 minutes to produce a Bitcoin block, Stacks-based apps also suffered from delayed block finality.\n\nSlow block confirmation time leads to high network latency which slows down transaction speeds. In a competitive financial ecosystem like an Ordinal lending protocol, delayed block finality can affect loan terms and settlements.\n\nMoreover, Stacks‚Äô initial version used microblocks to improve transaction time. The microblocks stored unconfirmed transactions from the mempool and validated them before writing to the Bitcoin chain.\n\nHowever, Stacks couldn‚Äôt ensure proper transaction data storage in the microblocks since there‚Äôs no consensus procedure to build from the latest microblock. Improper transaction data can also affect Ordinal lending protocols by altering loan amounts and periods.\n\nThe Stacks Nakamoto upgrade solves the problems by improving scalability, transaction speed, and proper transaction ordering.\n\nHow The Stacks Nakamoto Upgrade Can Improve Ordinal Lending Protocols\n\n## How The Stacks Nakamoto Upgrade Can Improve Ordinal Lending Protocols\n\nPost-Nakamoto Stacks uses a tenure-based block production that decouples the Stacks and Bitcoin block production mechanism.\n\nNow, Stacks uses cryptographic methods to select a new miner who begins a fresh tenure with each new Bitcoin block. Unlike the previous version, a single miner can now mine several Stacks blocks instead of a single block within a tenure.\n\nThe tenure-based block production speeds up transaction speeds and offers faster block finality on Bitcoin. Thus it helps Ordinal lending protocols like Liquidium to scale their operations and settle loans faster than before.\n\nThe Stacks Nakamoto upgrade also enables Stacks apps to write transaction data to the Bitcoin L1 chain with an indexed block hash. The indexed block hash refers to the first block hash of the previous Stacks miner that they mined during their tenure.\n\nStacks miners can now add the indexed block hash to the Bitcoin chain during the block commit transaction to solve miner connectivity issues. The post-Nakamoto Stacks also uses an Assumed Total Commitment With Carryforward (ATC-C) system to mitigate the Miner Extractable Value (MEV) problem.\n\nThese improvements in Stacks architecture resolve miner connectivity issues, prevent transaction manipulation strategies, and ensure fair mining behavior. Thus, post-Nakamoto Stacks bolsters Ordinal lending protocols with robust security to ensure the safety of collateralized Ordinals and correct loan disbursals.\n\nThe Future Of Ordinal Lending\n\n## The Future Of Ordinal Lending\n\nOrdinals have emerged as one of the most valuable Bitcoin-native digital assets in recent times. Ordinal lending empowers asset owners to further leverage an Ordinal‚Äôs liquidity without losing their asset ownership.\n\nTherefore, Ordinal lending platforms will play a significant role in strengthening Bitcoin DeFi and creating new avenues for yield generation. The future of Ordinal lending looks promising as more innovations advance the Bitcoin DeFi sector.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is a Bitcoin Block Explorer?\n\nA Bitcoin block explorer is a tool, webpage, or application that provides information about individual transactions, wallet addresses, and blocks on the Bitcoin network. It functions as a search engine for the entire Bitcoin transaction history, like a digital encyclopedia to look for specific on-chain data.\n\nUsers can navigate the data on the Bitcoin network through Bitcoin block explorers, providing an interface to read the blockchain. These block explorers use a relational database to organize transaction data in a table format for efficient information query and retrieval.\n\nBitcoin block explorers use Structured Query Language (SQL), earlier known as SEQUEL, to interact and extract information from the underlying database. Sometimes, developers can deploy APIs to programmatically communicate with Bitcoin block explorers for third-party applications like wallets, trading tools, and analytics platforms.\n\nSome prominent Bitcoin block explorers available for users are Blockchain.com‚Äôs[block explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)and Bitcoin.com‚Äôs[Blockchair](https://blockchair.com/explorers?from=bitcoin.com). Many users also opt to go to[Mempool.space](https://mempool.space/).\n\nWhy Should You Use a Bitcoin Block Explorer?\n\n## Why Should You Use a Bitcoin Block Explorer?\n\nPeople use Bitcoin block explorers to view a BTC transaction‚Äôs details, wallet histories, confirmation status, orphaned blocks, fees, and other information. These data points serve multiple purposes for different stakeholders in the crypto industry.\n\n- **Enhanced transparency**: Bitcoin block explorers enable users to verify transactions and fund transfers across wallet addresses for more clarity. Instead of trusting centralized intermediaries, users can directly verify the Bitcoin transaction data on block explorers.\n- **Conduct due diligence**: Users can bolster their transaction security by exploring transaction histories to ensure the counterparty‚Äôs authenticity and make informed financial choices. Bitcoin block explorers provide an opportunity to prevent scams and fraudulent transactions by verifying crypto wallet activities.\n- **Facilitate research and analysis**: Blockchain research firms, analytics companies, and security agencies can inspect Bitcoin transactions through block explorers. They can track on-chain activity and transaction patterns for research purposes to improve the health and other services within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nHow Do You Read a Bitcoin Block Explorer?\n\n## How Do You Read a Bitcoin Block Explorer?\n\nA Bitcoin block explorer displays several pieces of information like senders, recipients, transaction amounts, fees, and transaction confirmation status. It may seem a bit confusing to read transaction data from a Bitcoin block explorer so let‚Äôs understand each component separately.\n\n- **Transaction hash/ID**: Each BTC transaction has a[unique ID or transaction hash](https://leather.io/learn/txid)that functions as the specific transaction‚Äôs identifier. The ID or hash is a string of alphanumeric data that contains all the information about the particular transaction. If you want to find out the transaction details, copy-paste the ID or hash into the Bitcoin block explorer‚Äôs search bar and press enter.\n- **Sending address**: The sender‚Äôs address is the Bitcoin wallet address from which a transaction has originated. The address reveals how much BTC it is sending to a recipient. If you click on the sending address, you can see other details like the wallet address‚Äô incoming and outgoing transaction history.\n- **Receiving address**: The recipient‚Äôs address is the destination Bitcoin wallet address that receives the transaction. The address shows how much BTC it is receiving from the sender. When you click on the receiving address, you can see other information like the wallet address‚Äô complete transaction history.\n- **Transaction fees**: Each Bitcoin transaction has a corresponding fee that goes to the miners for validating transactions. Users can check the BTC fee for a particular transaction on a Bitcoin block explorer.\n- **Transaction status**: A BTC transaction is complete and becomes valid after miners check and add it to the Bitcoin chain. Every new block that miners add after a block of valid transactions offers additional security and prevents double-spending.\nBitcoin block explorers enable users to check the confirmation status of a particular BTC transaction. Some transactions have a higher confirmation time depending on the Bitcoin network congestion.\n\nHow to Read a Bitcoin Block Explorer with Leather\n\n## How to Read a Bitcoin Block Explorer with Leather\n\nYou can use Leather with a Bitcoin block explorer to find more details about a particular BTC transaction or your entire wallet‚Äôs history. If you want to know about a specific transaction made with your Leather, follow the steps below:\n\n- **Step 1**: Open Leather and find the transaction about which you want more information.\n- **Step 2**: Copy the transaction ID or hash of the specific transaction.\n- **Step 3**: Open your preferred Bitcoin block explorer.\n- **Step 4**: Paste your transaction ID or hash on the explorer‚Äôs search bar and see the transaction details.\nYou can view your complete wallet history from Leather. However, if you wish to check the transactions on a Bitcoin block explorer, follow the steps below:\n\n- **Step 1**: Open Leather and select your wallet address by[clicking on ‚ÄòReceive‚Äô.](https://leather.io/guides/receive-btc)\n- **Step 2**: Copy the wallet address.\n- **Step 3**: Open your preferred Bitcoin block explorer.\n- **Step 4**: Paste your wallet address on the explorer‚Äôs search bar to see your complete transaction history and crypto balance.\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-bitcoin-boos",
    "Body": "## History of Bitcoin Boos\n\nAs noted above, the creators were very early adopters of Ordinal technology, during the sub 10k era. An early introduction to the concept came from[seeing the Ordinal Punks collection](https://x.com/BitcoinBoos/status/1623405401743167489)(they ultimately made a[tribute Boo](https://x.com/BitcoinBoos/status/1623405401743167489)in their honor). The founders were very driven by the concept of permanence that Ordinals could provide. The fact that one could ‚Äútrack ownership of data uploaded to Bitcoin that can never be erased or edited‚Äù was a major[source of inspiration](https://twitter.com/KingBootoshi/status/1774548557946913231)in joining the Ordinal ecosystem. The genesis collection, as they call it, has been a labor of love for Bootoshi and Blootoshi, who have dedicated much of the last two years to developing the Boo Kingdom.\n\nIn the first message on their Discord, the founders[wrote](https://twitter.com/KingBootoshi/status/1738073086745043356)that ‚Äúthe idea for this started as [they] have noticed inscription trading brings us back to true peer to peer trading,‚Äù calling Ordinals ‚Äúthe wild west of digital history.‚Äù But the value that really demonstrates the ethos of this collection is its focus on community-building. It‚Äôs a philosophy that has driven much of the project‚Äôs development. ‚ÄúWhat you should be most concerned about is building and nurturing your community,‚Äù[said Bootoshi in an interview](https://founderscorner.substack.com/p/btc-nfts). ‚ÄúMany people who invest in a project and become a part of its Discord or community view it as more than an investment. It becomes a digital home, a place where they connect with like-minded individuals who share their passions and interests.‚Äù\n\nConcept Behind Bitcoin Boos\n\n## Concept Behind Bitcoin Boos\n\nThe Boos artwork consists of pixelated ghosts with a 90s gamer aesthetic, each featuring different styles of clothing or representing recognizable cultural icons. But what sets these Ordinals apart from other collections is that they have personalities. Each Boo has its own story ‚Äì and not just a simple backstory, either. They have their own sets of skills, attitudes and narrative. Think of the Boos as more of a character than a PFP. They come together in the colorful Boo Kingdom, where there are storybook-like retro games to be played, as well as plenty of humor and creativity.\n\nBitcoin Boos was able to achieve this artistic feat through their heavy emphasis on AI integration, which they‚Äôve used to give the Boos their own ‚Äúsouls.‚Äù Bootoshi has stated in an interview that his highest ideal with the project was to use AI to bring their stories to life and to provide value to the project‚Äôs holders. Part of that involved developing an AI-driven RPG MUD game, but it goes much further. The characters themselves are live on Discord to chat with, powered by AI. In short, the Boos aren‚Äôt just utility-free artwork. They‚Äôre actual entities, designed to provide use and profit for the holders.\n\nDevelopment of Bitcoin Boos\n\n## Development of Bitcoin Boos\n\nOne of the major challenges in building a collection so early was the lack of infrastructure to support it. Because Boos is a sub10K collection, it debuted at a time of relatively little development in the Ordinals space. This meant the founders had to confront the challenge of generating interest without user-friendly tools like Chrome extension wallets. The collection was able to partner for a launch with Magic Eden in March, but it had already been out for more than a month by the time it was able to do so.\n\nThe Boos founders initially used gaming to build their community. Each time a Boo was inscribed, the first member to identify it won it. They chose again to gamify their whitelist for later projects by having people communicate with the Boos through AI and build relationships with them in order to gain access. This has been a major part of their success; the Bitcoin Boos have been repeatedly cited for having a strong community on Discord and X.\n\nProjects Associated with Bitcoin Boos\n\n## Projects Associated with Bitcoin Boos\n\nAs mentioned above, the genesis Bitcoin Boos don‚Äôt stand alone. They are part of a wider ecosystem known as the Boo Kingdom, which also incorporates Bootallion, a ‚Äúcursed collection of 1820 unique digital warriors, each inscribed under the revered Boo King.‚Äù The Bootallion is inscribed on Block 9 sats and presents on-chain provenance, with the entire collection tying back to inscription #3314. The founders have also worked on separate projects, such as the Ordinals Chadbot, a ChatGPT-style AI bot designed to answer questions about Ordinals.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "what-makes-stacking-on-stacks-different-from-staking",
    "Body": "## How Does Staking Usually Work?\n\nLet‚Äôs take the example of Ethereum, a PoS blockchain. As an ETH holder, you could ‚Äòstake‚Äô or lock up your ETH, either directly, or through a staking pool. Staking pools combine the assets of several investors or ‚Äòstakers.‚Äô Staking means that you or your staking pool run a validator node. That means your or the staking pool‚Äôs job is to ensure that only valid transactions are added to the Ethereum network and ensure fraudulent transactions are discarded. Now, for your effort ‚Äî running a node is not easy ‚Äî you would receive rewards in the form of staked ETH (stETH).\n\nIt is important to note that staking is not an investment product that allows users to earn yield. Rather, it is a crucial mechanism that keeps the blockchain running safely. The rewards generated are essentially rewards that you receive for helping keep the network secure.\n\nNow that you understand the basic concept of staking, let‚Äôs look at how it‚Äôs different from ‚ÄòStacking.‚Äô\n\nHow is Stacking Different?\n\n## How is Stacking Different?\n\nThere are essentially two parts to understanding what makes Stacking unique. First is Stacks‚Äô unique consensus mechanism and second is the resulting Stacking rewards system.\n\n### Decoding PoX\n\nIn PoX, you have three main network participants ‚Äî the miners, the signers, and the stackers. The Nakamoto upgrade, however, has combined the role of stackers and signers, leaving only two main participants.\n\nStacks miners bid for a chance to mine a Stacks block, or in other words, write the next block. They bid using the base cryptocurrency, in this case, BTC. In a Proof-of-Burn consensus mechanism, the miners would have burned the BTC. But in PoX, the miners send the BTC to ‚Äòstackers,‚Äô who lock up or ‚Äòstack‚Äô STX, Stacks‚Äô native token. In other words, the BTC, instead of being burned, is sent to the stackers.\n\nThe winning miner is selected using a weighted random function. This means that the higher the amount of BTC the miners transfer, the higher their likelihood of getting selected.\n\nThe winning miner or block leader commits a block to the Stacks blockchain and receives newly minted STX, transaction fees, and smart contract fees. As signers, stackers act as the watchdog. They ensure that the blocks are valid and process transactions from Stacks to the Bitcoin network.\n\nAs Muneeb Ali, CEO of Trust Machines and co-creator of Stacks, noted in a recent[webinar](https://figment.io/insights/stacking-on-stacks-key-insights-from-our-latest-webinar/):\n\n‚ÄúMiners and signers play crucial roles in maintaining the network‚Äôs integrity, with miners bidding in BTC and signers validating blocks and processing BTC withdrawals.‚Äù\n\n### Receiving BTC via Stacking\n\nNow, the stackers, as mentioned above, are those that lock their STX for one of multiple cycles. Stackers can either directly stack their tokens, or by pooling their assets with other stackers. Now, here comes the twist that makes Stacking unique ‚Äî the stackers earn rewards in BTC for contributing to the network.\n\nRemember, with normal staking, the asset you lock and the rewards you receive are the same cryptocurrency. For instance, if you stake ETH, you earn more ETH as reward.\n\nWith Stacking, however, the stackers provide a BTC address where they can receive the bitcoin. Therefore, despite locking up STX, the stackers earn BTC as rewards ‚Äî the same BTC that miners transfer in their bid to become a block leader. To put it simply, the BTC that miners use to bid goes to the wallets of the stackers.\n\nAs Ali iterated in the webinar, ‚ÄúYou earn BTC by locking STX and performing work for the network, which is a unique proposition in the crypto industry.‚Äù\n\nOpening New Opportunities For Users With Stacking\n\n## Opening New Opportunities For Users With Stacking\n\nStacks‚Äô groundbreaking PoX consensus mechanism allows stackers to earn BTC by locking up STX. And this is what gives staking on Stacks its unique tincture.\n\nThere are two main benefits of the Stacking mechanism. Firstly, STX Stacking does not require expensive hardware or equipment. You can easily do it using the Leather wallet or other STX-compatible wallets.\n\nSecondly, since the rewards are paid in BTC, stackers are likely to unload their BTC rewards rather than sell STX if they wish to liquidate their earnings. This means that the mining and Stacking process does not put any sell pressure on STX itself. In other words, the price of STX is not impacted by the Stacking process.\n\nIt bears repeating, however, that the point of Stacking is to secure the Stacks network, which enables faster and cheaper transactions. It‚Äôs not about earning rewards. However, with earnings given out in BTC, Stacking can be a way for STX holders to increase their BTC holdings.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-nodemonkes",
    "Body": "## History and Concept Behind NodeMonkes\n\nThe NodeMonkes art consists of vaguely squashed-looking color blocks that combine to form pixelated monkeys with various traits. The art has become instantly recognizable within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Interested buyers can also use the NodeMonkes website to review their Monkedex, which sorts the collection by rarity and can help potential holders determine what traits they want in their PFP. Some of the project‚Äôs inscriptions have references to CryptoPunk aliens, which tend to be popular with collectors and have driven up the value of those specific pictures.\n\nCreated by an anonymous duo, the project has no roadmap. What it does have in spades is hype. The NodeMonkes collection came to life with an unusual amount of anticipation. Ordinal collectors prize early inscriptions for their value and historical significance, and the satoshis used for NodeMonkes were inscribed early on. The inscriptions are in the 80K-110K range, making them desirable to holders. Another reason they were so highly anticipated is their claimed status of being the first 10K Ordinals collection ‚Äì a claim also ascribed by some to[Bitcoin Frogs](https://leather.io/blog/guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-bitcoin-frogs).\n\nThe rules for who can lay claim to the title of first 10,000 PFP collection on Ordinals can be a little bit murky, but there are two collections that are generally in the conversation. Bitcoin Frogs launched in March 2023, while NodeMonkes launched in December. But the trophy boils down to how you define the word ‚Äòfirst‚Äô ‚Äì whether you mean the earliest inscriptions or the first collection to be released and minted out. For the most part, when it comes to Ordinals, people go by the inscription date. This would give the title to NodeMonkes, who inscribed their collection in February.\n\nNodeMonkes crew also has a strong community behind them, and it‚Äôs common to see slogans like ‚ÄúSend Nodes‚Äù on social media. This online community, combined with their commercial value, has led the collection to be among the most successful in the Ordinal ecosystem.\n\nDevelopment of NodeMonkes\n\n## Development of NodeMonkes\n\nThe reason the NodeMonkes team took so many months between inscribing their collection and minting it out was to wait for the Ordinal ecosystem to get more fleshed out. It worked. By the time they launched, there were none of the growing pains that the earliest releases faced. No Google Sheets order books or trades made by trusting people on social media ‚Äì instead, there were marketplaces built up and native wallets in place.\n\nThough the collection has been a resounding success, the launch itself was a bit controversial. Initially, the founders said the collection would be a free mint and claimed they‚Äôd refused a $5 million offer for the project from venture capitalists. But they later changed their tune, deciding to go with a Dutch auction-based launch. This kicked off on December 21, 2023, with a starting price of .21 BTC. After just four days of trading, the collection surpassed 500 BTC in volume. Their staying power in the Ordinal ecosystem is obvious; despite launching almost a year ago, they are still one of the top collections on sites like Magic Eden.\n\nProjects Associated with NodeMonkes\n\n## Projects Associated with NodeMonkes\n\nIn addition to the main NodeMonkes, the team also developed a separate project that honors Web3 luminaries with a 400-image collection. This was largely promotional in nature, but it was used to great effect by the team, as the recipients were high-profile members of the crypto community. Their responses to the artwork often were widely distributed to their followers.\n\nBy providing these luminaries with honorary NodeMonkes based on their image, the team garnered a ton of eyeballs online and drew valuable attention to the project in critical, early days.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Title": "Why Transactions Fail: Common Error Messages and Their Solutions",
    "Slug": "why-transactions-fail-common-error-messages-and-their-solutions",
    "Body": "## Why Crypto Transaction Failures Matter?\n\nAccording to[Cointelegraph research](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/global-crypto-onramp-analysis.pdf), 50% of the KYC-completed fiat-crypto transactions fail. Additionally, the authorization rate is even lower in Africa, at 8%, followed by South America (21%) and Asia (30%).\n\nEnabling a smooth transactional experience for crypto users is essential to foster the industry. Frequent failures while sending, receiving, or staking digital assets will discourage both existing and new users from conducting crypto[transactions](https://docs.stacks.co/stacks-101/transactions).\n\nEducating users to follow the best transactional practices, such as choosing high liquidity tokens, helps them significantly reduce failure rates.\n\nCommon Error Messages and Their Solutions\n\n## Common Error Messages and Their Solutions\n\n### Rate Expired Error\n\nIt is common to receive a 'rate expired' error if it takes longer to confirm transactions on crypto platforms. Most platforms offer at least a 10-second window before refreshing with a new price and gas fees.\n\nOnce you encounter this error, no[fees](https://docs.stacks.co/stacks-101/network#fees)will be deducted from your wallet, but you can't proceed with your transaction at the rate that you previously agreed upon. You need to retry your transaction based on the updated rate.\n\nFor example, suppose you agreed to buy SOL tokens based on the market price of $150. The platform takes the possible volatility risk by locking the price so that you can complete the transaction at $150 for a specific time.\n\nSolutions\n\nCheck the price refresh rate of the crypto platform before conducting the transaction to avoid rate expired errors. This is particularly important on centralized exchanges, as decentralized platforms typically don't have fixed refresh rates. However, regardless of the platform, ensure a stable internet connection before proceeding with any crypto transaction.\n\n### Payment Failed Error\n\nTransactions that fail to finalize due to payment-related issues fall under the 'payment failed' error category.\n\nFor instance, in[Stacks](https://docs.stacks.co/stacks-101/what-is-stacks), this error might arise if a transaction involving the native STX token transfer is incomplete, meaning it‚Äôs either not processed at all or only partially processed.\n\nEnsure your Leather wallet has sufficient funds to cover the transaction, including the cryptocurrency you're sending and any associated network fees. These fees can vary depending on network congestion and the specific blockchain you're using.\n\nIt's advisable to have a small buffer to account for these fluctuations and prevent your transaction from failing due to insufficient funds.\n\n### Unconfirmed and Pending Transactions Error\n\nAn unconfirmed and pending transactions[error](https://docs.stacks.co/clarity/example-contracts/stacking#errors)occurs when your transaction has been initiated but hasn't been validated and added to the blockchain. This means it's waiting to be included in a block by miners or validators, depending on the specific blockchain mechanism.\n\nFor example, pending transactions on[Bitcoin](https://stacks.org/building-on-bitcoin-halving-recap)exist in a mempool that acts as a waiting area until the confirmation. Entering the wrong wallet address might also result in a pending transaction that will eventually become a failed transaction.\n\nNetwork congestion is a major factor determining the speed at which transactions are updated on the respective blockchains, especially during peak trading hours. When congestion rates peak, it leads to a backlog of pending and unconfirmed transactions.\n\nYou can use the Leather browser extension‚Äôs activities tab to[increase the fee](https://leather.io/guides/increase-fee)to complete the pending transaction in less time. Also, double-check the recipient‚Äôs wallet address, as the address of Bitcoin or Stacks differs from that of Ordinals, resulting in pending transactions.\n\nGo through the Leather guidelines before initiating Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, or Bitcoin transactions. For example, to send Ordinals, users need to enter the Taproot address starting with bc1p in the ‚ÄòCollectibles‚Äô section and hit ‚Äúsend‚Äù.\n\nOne of the best options is to plan for your transactions during low network congestion, which can be analyzed with the help of free online tools. If the transaction is not urgent, it is better to wait until the process is completed.\n\n### Out of Gas Error\n\nWhen you encounter an 'out of gas' error, it means that the fee for that particular crypto transaction is below the required threshold.\n\nYou can view such failed transactions on block explorers, such as[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)transaction status, as \"fail\" and \"Out of gas\" messages just below the receiver's wallet address section.\n\nAlways ensure you have a clear understanding of the[estimated gas fees](https://leather.io/guides/pending-transactions)required for your transaction. Leather wallet typically provides this estimate before you confirm a transaction.\n\nIt's advisable to have sufficient funds in your wallet to cover both the transaction amount and the gas fee. In some cases, increasing the gas limit you're willing to pay can help your transaction get processed faster, especially during periods of high network congestion.\n\n[Leather also suggests different fee amounts](https://leather.gitbook.io/guides/transactions/fees)ranked in the order of percentile of fees for successful transactions. The ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù fee amount is selected by default, which corresponds to the 50th percentile.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/7646d7c1827f31558eebae89e34a6ca7.png)\n\n### Dust UTXO Error\n\nDust refers to the tiny amount of tokens, which is a kind of unspendable present in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model-based cryptos such as BTC, LTC, BCH, DOGE, etc.\n\nYour transaction for these cryptos shows a[UTXO](https://docs.stacks.co/sbtc/sbtc-design/sbtc-requests-and-responses/commit-reveal-system#reveal-transaction)error as the token's value is less than the fees charged.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that a wallet address contains a balance of 0.0065 BTC and four UTXOs of 0.0048, 0.0009, 0.0006, and 0.0002. As this BTC wallet has three dust UTXOs (0.0009, 0.0006, and 0.0002), it results in a 'dust UTXO error' when attempting to transact the overall available 0.0065 BTC.\n\nSolution\n\nOne of the best methods that you can follow to avoid 'dust UTXO error' is to refrain from sending tokens that are valued below the transaction[fees](https://docs.stacks.co/stacks-101/network#fees).\n\nLeather addresses the dust UTXO error by ensuring that each transaction leaves a sufficient amount of satoshis (at least 546 sats) with the inscription to stay above the dust limit. The process involves calculating the difference between the total output and the sat offset, ensuring the fee leaves enough sats to avoid the dust error. This precise calculation helps in unravelling inscriptions while avoiding dust UTXO issues.\n\nConclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe transactional failures discussed in this article are the most common ones in the crypto space. Selecting platforms with high liquidity, opting for a higher gas fee, maintaining enough token balance, and choosing a low congestion period can help you avoid common errors such as 'unconfirmed' and 'pending' transaction errors.\n\nChoosing the right wallet, such as Leather, can also significantly reduce transaction errors by leveraging built-in features designed to handle these issues. Leather provides precise calculations to avoid dust UTXO errors, automatic fee adjustments to avoid out-of-gas errors, and guides to ensure correct transaction procedures. These integrated solutions help users navigate the complexities of crypto transactions more smoothly, reducing the likelihood of encountering common errors.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## The Brains Behind Audionals\n\n[Jim.btc](https://x.com/jimdotbtc), a former musician and sound engineer, is the mastermind behind Audionals. His journey into the crypto world was driven by curiosity and a passion for problem-solving. As Jim puts it in a recent X Space hosted by Leather, \"I was testing whether I could store audio and record and play it‚Ä¶ I just kept testing the water, pushing how far I could go.\"\n\nHis persistence led to the creation of a new protocol for putting audio on-chain, culminating in the first recursive music collection on Bitcoin, which sold out in just over an hour.\n\nWith no formal training in finance or blockchain technology, Jim learned through trial and error, gradually building his knowledge and refining his approach. \"I was technically minded but had no idea about finance or any of this sort of stuff. Once I got into crypto, I started learning about code, and that learning formed into what it is now,\" recounts one part of his journey.\n\nJim‚Äôs relentless pursuit of knowledge and improvement has been key to the success of Audionals and clearly shows the project's innovative spirit.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3cebaec9153585f0ffe4c14c65e327c7.png)\n\nWhat is Audionals?\n\n## What is Audionals?\n\nAudionals is a tool designed for developers, sound engineers, musicians, and audiophile collectors to inscribe audio files directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. By leveraging the transparent and immutable nature of Bitcoin, Audionals offers a unique way to inscribe audio data as Base64-encoded JSON files. This not only ensures the permanence and security of the audio files but also allows for extensive metadata to be included, such as the audio format, genre, key, BPM, and more.\n\nThe significance of this technology cannot be overstated. Audionals provides a platform where music can be permanently stored and accessed, ensuring that artists retain control and ownership over their creations.\n\nWhile similar efforts have long been explored on Ethereum, this marks the first time such innovation has been successfully implemented on Bitcoin. The project could potentially disrupt the traditional music industry by offering a decentralized and transparent alternative to current production and distribution models.\n\nHow Does Audionals Work?\n\n## How Does Audionals Work?\n\nThe core technology behind Audionals involves converting audio files into Base64 format, which is then embedded within a JSON file. This method makes the audio data easily indexable and sortable, facilitating efficient searching and organization. Jim explains, \"You can put it in a JSON file, which means you can also add loads of metadata‚Ä¶ What key is it in? What tempo is it in? What instrument is it, who made it, who owns it?\" This comprehensive approach allows for the creation of a searchable and user-friendly database of audio files.\n\nAnother exciting aspect of Audionals is its use of recursive techniques, allowing new music to be created by building on existing audio inscriptions. Jim elaborates, \"I created a little loop machine‚Ä¶ it would find that audio, convert it into an audio buffer, and play it when I pressed the button.\"\n\nThat ‚Äúlittle loop machine‚Äù is the[OrdSPD](https://audionals.com/ordSPD/)(Audional Sample Pad), an easy-to-use regenerative Bitcoin Ordinal Mixer for Audional Smart Samples. This tool allows users to play around with inscribed samples, adjust the BPM, volume, playback speed, and loop length to create their own mix and download it as a JSON file. This process enables efficient and modular music production directly on-chain, opening up endless possibilities for creativity.\n\nAudionals also supports the inscription of high-resolution audio, adding significant value for musicians and producers seeking to maintain the quality of their work. By inscribing studio-quality samples, users can layer lower-resolution audio on top, creating rich, dynamic compositions. This method, long used in traditional music production, can now be transferred entirely on-chain, ensuring the same level of quality and efficiency.\n\n\"We were going for short, sweet samples‚Ä¶ getting all these amazing, high-resolution audio on chain,\" Jim highlights. ‚ÄúOnce you have a high-resolution audio backing track, you can overlay lower-resolution audio, process it, and output it again with studio quality.‚Äù\n\nWhat's Next For Audionals?\n\n## What's Next For Audionals?\n\nLooking ahead, Audionals aims to refine and expand its capabilities. Jim envisions a future where entire music production processes, from composition to mixing to mastering, can be conducted on-chain. The goal is to make these tools open and accessible, allowing others to build on top of what he has created.\n\nMoreover, Audionals plans to integrate various permanent data storage solutions like Arweave to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. This combination of technologies promises to reshape the musical landscape, offering artists a transparent and equitable way to distribute their work and track its usage. During the interview, Jim noted the potential for cost-effective storage solutions: \"1 GB of permanent, immutable storage space on Arweave costs $10 - for life.\"\n\nAnother future development includes the implementation of a royalty framework. Jim mentions, \"If we do find a way to get the real world to start utilizing this as a royalty mechanism, every element can become attributable for its participation.\" This would ensure that every contributor, from the composer to the producer, receives fair compensation for their work, further democratizing the music industry.\n\nConclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAudionals represents a significant leap forward in the music industry, harnessing the power of Bitcoin to offer a revolutionary approach to music creation, ownership, and distribution. By providing a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform, Audionals empowers artists and paves the way for unprecedented music creativity and innovation on Bitcoin.\n\nIn essence, Audionals is not just an outstanding tool, but also a movement towards a more open, transparent, and equitable music industry. It allows artists to maintain control over their work, ensures that every contribution is recognized and compensated, and opens up new avenues for creativity and collaboration. With innovators like Jim leading the way, the future of music on Bitcoin looks incredibly promising.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "History\n\n## History of n0 0rdinary kind\n\nThe n0 0rdinary kind collection was designed by the London-based[One Penny Piece](https://twitter.com/onepennypiece), an acclaimed stencil artist. It features 7,680 recursive Ordinals that were inscribed to Block 9 450X satoshis and has[described itself](https://x.com/SeizeCTRL/status/1818363302420136367)as the ‚Äúonly Ordinals collection descending from 2 rare sats.‚Äù The CTRL team is motivated by resisting the harms caused by traditional, centralized financial systems and created the collection to ‚Äúinhabit the post-fiat future.‚Äù\n\nAccording to the team‚Äôs[website](https://www.seizectrl.io/lore)lore, ‚Äún0k openly challenges and resists the over-reaching, weaponized grip of central finance, unafraid to illuminate the circus of tyranny imposed upon global citizens. Fiat has failed us. Dollars inflate, banks break, but Bitcoin is immutable.‚Äù It‚Äôs an ideology they take seriously, but is tinged with a subtle sense of humor. Among the just[13 people their X account follows](https://twitter.com/SeizeCTRL/following)is U.S. Treasury Sec. Janet Yellen.\n\nThe n0k collection follows up and expands upon the CTRL team‚Äôs genesis mint from last year, which was focused on individual sovereignty. That same underlying theme of self-determination is evident in the design structure of each n0k, which begins as a ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù PFP that holders can choose to unwrap in multiple stages, revealing the ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô of what is within their inscription.\n\nConcept\n\n## Concept Behind n0 0rdinary kind\n\nTo state the obvious, the external art is essentially a[condom wrapper](https://mintorskip.com/drops/ctrl-n0-0rdinary-kind)with a masked black figure on the front. The first level of rarity entails the wrapper color, which could be[gold, holo (silver), or green](https://twitter.com/SeizeCTRL/status/1806003678173864171). The ‚Äúfinal‚Äù PFP ‚Äì and its various rarity traits ‚Äì lies inside of the wrapper, waiting to be revealed by its holder in a multi-stage sequence. The first unwrap[reveals](https://www.seizectrl.io/lore)‚Äúall traits except the Left Eye and Phase 2 reveals the fully unwrapped n0k.‚Äù\n\nTechnically, you can keep your n0k fully wrapped. The autonomy theme of the collection means holders are not obligated to unwrap their PFP. But to unravel the mystery of your PFP‚Äôs traits, you have to take that plunge. Once unwrapped, they cannot be rewrapped. The unwrapping process also impacts rarity, as traits are randomly assigned. Over time, as more n0ks are unwrapped, more traits emerge.\n\nDevelopment\n\n## Development of n0 0rdinary kind\n\nThe n0 0rdinary kind collection is an ode to binary code,[honoring](https://www.seizectrl.io/lore)‚Äúthe foundational role of binary numbers in cryptography.‚Äù Each one is derived from two rare sat parents, utilizing a child-parent relationship with the first rare sat to be inscribed and the second rare sat ever found. These rare parents passed down 1s and 0s to each n0k. The collection has minted out, but they can be purchased through the Magic Eden or Gamma secondary markets.\n\nIf you decide to unwrap your n0k, you can do so through the[Seize CTRL website](https://www.seizectrl.io/)by connecting your wallet through a read-only connection. The team emphasizes that at no point will they have control over the assets inside your wallet during this process. After connecting, you‚Äôll get the option to unwrap your n0k by inscribing ‚Äúchildren‚Äù with your n0k as a parent. For more details on completing this process, you can see the FAQ portion of the site.\n\nPartial unwrapping allows collectors to utilize rarity in trades while still maintaining some of the initial mystery of the wrapped PFP, but there are other incentives to unwrap your n0k. Collectors can play the team‚Äôs poker-style N00RDINARYKARDS (KARDS) game where they receive a KARD at each stage of the unwrap (collectors can receive up to two KARDS total). Once the on-chain KARDS game begins, n0k holders will be able to use their KARDS to collect the N‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢K Rune #120.\n\nOn the other hand, maintaining a wrapped PFP as others succumb to the pressure to unwrap their own will allow the last wraps standing to increase in rarity in their own right.\n\nAssociated Projects\n\n## Projects Associated with n0 0rdinary kind\n\nAs noted above, n0 0rdinary kind is the second collection in the CTRL story. Their first, Seize CTRL, is a collection of 404 unique pieces of art inscribed on 404 uncommon sats. The Seize CTRL collection minted on June 28, 2023. As of now, they can be acquired through[Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/seizectrl)and[Gamma.io](https://gamma.io/ordinals/collections/seizectrl).\n\nnan\n\n",

So, ROO is almost like the ticket to the experience,‚Äù says Jack. ‚ÄúWe want to take crypto and find ways to make fun games, make things that support the health of the ROO token overall through the long term‚Ä¶ How do you get longevity out of that?‚Äù\n\nFor the team behind ROO, the token itself is just one of the first elements of a much larger overall project that leverages the collaborative and enterprising nature of the larger Bitcoin community. Eventually, ROO will be synonymous with meaningful product development and commerce in the age of Web3, and might one day even become a household name if Jack, Ian, and the rest of the ROO Mob have their say.\n\n## ROO‚Äôs Growth: DMT Mints and More\n\nFrom the beginning, ROO has collaborated closely with Stacks, a Bitcoin layer 2 token and platform upon which developers can build dApps and larger ecosystem projects that use bitcoin as their secure base layer. Jack is a self-described Stacks OG, and one of ROO‚Äôs earliest forays into building out its community via experimentation with new crypto experiences is[Stacks Invaders](https://www.stacks-invaders.xyz/), a generative art project which utilizes the innovative[Digital Matter Theory (DMT) on the Stacks blockchain](https://leather.io/blog/what-is-digital-matter-theory-(dmt)-a-stacks-invaders-case-study). This approach, which has been explored on Bitcoin for a while, provides a more secure, immutable, and decentralized way of managing digital art.\n\nThrough DMT, all elements are generated and saved on-chain rather than being hosted externally using IPFS. This makes the project not only the first block generative art on Stacks but also introduces a new NFT standard, highlighting the potential of the Stacks blockchain in supporting innovative and technologically advanced NFT projects.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool to actually take something and be the first to bring it to a chain, always, but what‚Äôs cooler than that, when you already get the attention of other people in the space who are like, ‚Äòcool, let‚Äôs build this out, let‚Äôs see where this is going, let‚Äôs explore this, see what‚Äôs up, and then let‚Äôs make a SIP about it,‚Äù says Jack.\n\nStacks Invaders is a community-built and maintained project integrated into ROO‚Äôs greater roadmap. It exists as a proof of concept of sorts, and as another opportunity for ROO‚Äôs community members to be directly involved with the token‚Äôs development and experimentation centered around innovation. Jack and Ian plan to expand even further with JOEY, ROO‚Äôs upcoming DeFi component, in the future.\n\nThe entire ROO movement is moving at an impressive pace, with Stacks Invaders minted out after its 40-day run ‚Äì Jack says it would have minted out on the first day had it not been a DMT mint ‚Äì and JOEY‚Äôs development taking center stage at ROO HQ.\n\n## Building Communities on Stacks with ROO\n\nSo, can a meme coin be more than a meme coin?\n\nFor the ROO Mob, absolutely. It can be a passport, a ticket to ride, and an opportunity to be part of a community that might just end up building the next great innovative product in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nAnd ROO is just one of the many communities on the Stacks ecosystem looking to make DeFi and crypto more accessible for Bitcoin users. Over the years, these communities are taking on a bigger and bigger role in onboarding more users to the Stacks ecosystem and the wider Bitcoin landscape.\n\nFalse nan\n\n",

    "Slug": "what-is-bitcoin-fee-estimation-and-how-does-it-work",
    "Body": "## What Is Bitcoin Fee Estimation?\n\n[BTC transaction](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-transactions)senders must determine a fee they‚Äôre willing to pay to include their transaction in a new block. A higher fee means a greater probability of a faster confirmation while a lower fee may lead to delayed confirmation times.\n\nMiners mine a new block every ten minutes and choose which transactions to include depending on the transaction fees. A greater fee will encourage miners to pick it up earlier compared to other transactions with lower fees.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees don‚Äôt depend on the BTC amount you‚Äôre sending but on the transaction size and block space demand. Since each Bitcoin block can store 4 MB of data, transactions with larger sizes require higher fees.\n\nFor example, a Bitcoin Ordinal transaction worth $500 may cost more compared to a BTC transfer worth $1000 because the former has a larger transaction size.\n\nTypes of Bitcoin Fee Estimation Methods\n\n## Types of Bitcoin Fee Estimation Methods\n\nWhen you send BTC, the wallet shows an option to select a fee rate. The fee rate is the satoshis (smallest BTC unit) you‚Äôd pay for every byte of the transaction represented in sats/vByte or satoshis per virtual byte.\n\nThere are two ways to determine the fee rate for a Bitcoin transaction.\n\n### Mempool-based estimation\n\nYou can analyze the Bitcoin mempool, the memory pool containing unconfirmed BTC transactions, from which miners select and add transactions to Bitcoin blocks. The mempool provides a real-time fee rate overview of recent pending transactions to understand the existing fee landscape.\n\nA mempool estimation is responsive to short-term market changes and provides accurate suggestions based on updated data from the mempool‚Äôs contents. This method is useful if you want rapid transaction confirmation from miners in the next few blocks.\n\nFor example,[Mempool space](https://mempool.space/)provides a visually rich and graphical representation of Bitcoin‚Äôs fee rates.\n\n### History-based estimation\n\nYou can use historical transaction data to predict an estimated fee trend for future transactions. This method analyzes old data to identify patterns, fee movements, and fluctuations over time to provide a stable fee estimation.\n\nA historical estimation is suitable for flexible confirmation times when users are not in a hurry for immediate transaction confirmation.\n\nFor example,[Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/)uses a history-based fee estimation technique where it groups transactions into similar fee rate buckets. It tracks the confirmation time over different periods applying a decay factor for each dataset and success thresholds.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Fee Estimation Work?\n\n## How Does Bitcoin Fee Estimation Work?\n\nSome crypto wallets and Bitcoin fee estimation tools use real-time data from the Bitcoin network to suggest transaction fees. They analyze the blockchain‚Äôs current state and predict a fee you‚Äôve to pay to confirm the transaction within a specific timeframe.\n\nBitcoin fee estimators offer a seamless way to calculate transaction fees in the following manner:\n\n- **Data Collation**- Fee calculators collect data from the Bitcoin mempool and the latest mined blocks to get an overview of pending transactions and existing fee dynamics.\n- **Data Analysis**- Calculators analyze the data to understand block space demand and total unconfirmed transactions to determine the fee structure.\n- **Fee Estimation**- The tools use the collected data to recommend a fee for different confirmation times (fast-10 minutes, medium-30 minutes, slow-1 hour) depending on network congestion.\n- **Real-time Updates**- These tools constantly update the fee rate depending on mempool data and the latest network status to provide an accurate fee estimation.\nHow To Calculate Optimal Bitcoin Transaction Fees\n\n## How To Calculate Optimal Bitcoin Transaction Fees\n\nYou can calculate Bitcoin transaction fees by estimating the transaction size and fee rate and multiplying them.\n\n### Estimate the transaction size\n\nA typical Bitcoin transaction consists of inputs and outputs. Inputs refer to past BTC transactions you received and outputs refer to the addresses you‚Äôre sending BTC to.\n\nFor example, you have 1 BTC in your wallet which is comprised of multiple small inputs of 0.1 BTC. If you send 1 BTC to someone, the transaction will contain all your input transactions.\n\nThe transaction size is the sum of inputs, outputs, and an additional fixed overhead size of each transaction.\n\n### Choose fee rate\n\nThe fee rate fluctuates according to block space demand, network congestion, and unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. You can find the recent average fee rate for different time spans from Bitcoin fee estimators or wallets like Leather[give estimates based on an average across various networks](https://leather.io/guides/configure-transaction-fees).\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/7646d7c1827f31558eebae89e34a6ca7.png)\n\n### Calculate transaction fees\n\nFinally, you have to multiply the transaction size in bytes by the fee rate to get the Bitcoin transaction fees in sats/vByte.\n\nFor example, each transaction input is about 148 bytes, output is 34 bytes, and overhead size is 10 bytes. If we have 2 inputs and outputs for a transaction, then the total transaction size is 374 bytes. To break it down:\n\n- **Input**: 2*148=296 bytes\n- **Output**: 2*34=68 bytes\n- **Overhead**: 10 bytes\n- **Total size**: 374 bytes (296+68+10)\nIf the average fee rate is 50 satoshis per byte, the total transaction fee is 18,700 satoshis (374 bytes*50 satoshis) or $12.69.\n\nHow To Optimize Bitcoin Transaction Fees\n\n## How To Optimize Bitcoin Transaction Fees\n\nYou can take fee suggestions from calculators and wallets but further optimize your Bitcoin transaction fees by following the steps below:\n\n- **Choose the correct time**- You should try to choose a time when the Bitcoin network is not busy for cheaper and faster transaction settlements.\n- **Verify the mempool**- You must always verify the Bitcoin mempool to understand pending transactions status and average fees before manually choosing your fee rate.\n- **Reduce transaction size**- Since fees depend on the transaction size, you can reduce sizes by grouping transaction inputs and using[SegWit Bitcoin addresses](https://leather.io/learn/segwit-native-segwit).\nTop 3 Bitcoin Fee Estimation Tools\n\n## Top 3 Bitcoin Fee Estimation Tools\n\nBitcoin fee estimation tools help you calculate an average fee for a BTC transaction according to existing network conditions. Some of the popular fee estimators are:\n\n### Bitcoiner.live\n\n[Bitcoiner.live estimator](https://bitcoiner.live/)is a website that provides real-time data to help Bitcoin users calculate optimal fees for their transactions. Users can choose from multiple confirmation targets to balance transaction speed and costs according to their needs.\n\nThe tool provides an intuitive user-friendly interface, historical data access, easy visualization, and API integration for third-party applications. Bitcoiner.live is suitable for first-timers, frequent BTC users, merchants, traders, crypto companies, and developers.\n\n### BitcoinFees\n\nThe[BitcoinFees estimator tool](https://bitcoinfees.net/)provides transaction fee estimations for different time targets. The estimator analyzes the Bitcoin network‚Äôs current state and previous states to provide a fee estimation.\n\nBitcoinFees displays a chart for advanced users to graphically represent the mempool to see network load and avoid peak times. Moreover, users can avail of the[transaction accelerator](https://bitaccelerate.com/)to push forward a stuck transaction with a lower fee.\n\n### BTC Network Fee Estimator\n\nThe[BTC Network fee calculator tool](https://btc.network/estimate)has a simple user interface to calculate the optimal fees for Bitcoin transactions. It provides an estimated fee with a sliding bar to adjust the time frame and number of blocks.\n\nUsers can further enter inputs and outputs to calculate the total transaction size in bytes and estimate fee rates in sats/vByte. The tool also shows the time since the last block, the mempool size, unconfirmed transactions, and a 7-day fee comparison with average fees.\n\nHow Crypto Wallets Estimate Bitcoin Transaction Fees\n\n## How Crypto Wallets Estimate Bitcoin Transaction Fees\n\nSome crypto wallets automatically calculate the transaction fee and you can go with it, depending on your urgency. However, other wallets don‚Äôt let you choose a fee because of their default fee-setting structure, leading to overpaying for transactions.\n\nBitcoin wallets like[Leather](https://leather.io/)simplify BTC transaction fees by automatically determining an optimal fee depending on the network status. Moreover, users have the choice to manually adjust the fee by increasing or decreasing it, depending on their confirmation immediacy.\n\nTherefore, you can either directly use Leather to opt for its automatic fee calculation or use an estimator tool to manually set the fees. This provides more flexibility and efficiency, empowering you to make decisions based on your requirements without overpaying or underpaying for your transactions.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "What is UTXO?\n\n## What Is Bitcoin UTXO?\n\nA Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is a small unit of BTC (a.k.a. Dust) that remains after a transaction. It represents a specific amount of BTC that has been authorized by a sender and is available to be spent by a recipient.\n\nWhen[Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled Bitcoin in 2009](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), BTC was the first digital currency to introduce the UTXO model. Following Bitcoin‚Äôs success, more protocols, such as Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), implemented this model.\n\nThink of UTXOs as coins in your pocket.\n\nEach coin has a specific value, and you can combine them to make a payment. Similarly, when you want to send BTC, your wallet software will select and combine multiple UTXOs to make up the desired amount. Any leftover BTC from this process is returned to you as a new UTXO (your change).\n\nJust like you can't split a physical coin, you can't split a UTXO.\n\nLet‚Äôs understand with a hypothetical transaction example.\n\nIf you have 3 UTXOs (0.5 BTC, 0.2 BTC, and 0.1 BTC) and want to send 0.6 BTC, your wallet will select the 0.5 BTC and 0.1 BTC UTXOs as inputs. The transaction will create two outputs: 0.6 BTC for the recipient and 0.2 BTC as change back to you (which becomes a new UTXO).\n\nOften, the leftover ‚Äúdust‚Äù, 0.2 BTC in our example, is ignored due to its insignificant nature (the amount is generally much smaller IRL).\n\nHow It Works\n\n## Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO Model: How It Works\n\nBitcoin uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model to track ownership, transactions, and prevent double-spending.\n\nWhen you receive Bitcoin, you're essentially getting a new UTXO added to your collection. If you want to spend BTC, you need to use one or more of your existing UTXOs.\n\nBut what if you want to spend a small amount, say 0.1 BTC, but the smallers UTXO in your wallet is only 0.2 BTC?\n\nIf you need to send a smaller amount than what a single UTXO holds, your wallet will automatically select and combine multiple UTXOs to make up the right amount. Any leftover amount is returned to you as a new, smaller UTXO.\n\nEach UTXO has a history attached to it, showing where it came from and who owned it previously. This history is permanently recorded on the blockchain, Bitcoin's public ledger. This makes all transactions transparent and traceable,helping to prevent fraud and double-spending.\n\nLeather, as a Bitcoin wallet, helps you manage your UTXOs. It automatically selects the right UTXOs for your transactions, calculates any change you're owed, and ensures that your Bitcoin transactions are secure and valid.\n\nIf the UTXOs match the exact value of the required transactions, you will not receive any UTXOs in return.\n\nData Structure\n\n### UTXO Data Structure\n\nWe mentioned earlier that a large number of UTXOs add to the transaction fees as they increase data size. So, what does the data look like?\n\nEach UTXO is a data structure containing:\n\n- Transaction ID: A unique hash identifying the transaction that created this UTXO.\n- Output Index: Indicates the specific output within the transaction (since a single transaction can have multiple outputs).\n- Value: The amount of Bitcoin associated with this UTXO (in satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin).\n- Locking Script (ScriptPubKey): A small script specifying the conditions that must be met to spend this UTXO.This typically involves providing a valid digital signature proving ownership of the associated Bitcoin address.\nStacks Considerations\n\n## How Does Stacks Implement Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO Model?\n\nStacks operates using Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model to function as a blockchain with the[finality](https://leather.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin-finality-achieving-100-bitcoin-finality-with-stacks)and security of Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain. It uses[Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/clarity/overview), a smart contract language specifically designed for predictability and security.\n\nClarity's smart contracts play a crucial role in Stacks' interaction with Bitcoin's UTXO model to manage assets and state. Clarity is also secure because its design eliminates the risks (like re-entrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, memory safety issues) associated with popularly used compiled smart contract languages like Solidity, Vyper, Rust, etc.\n\n[STX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/)is Stacks‚Äô native token, which can be used to pay transaction fees, register names, and participate in consensus. All STX transactions follow the UTXO model to execute Bitcoin-like transactions consisting of inputs, outputs, and scripts that define spending conditions.\n\n[Proof of transfer (PoX)](https://docs.stacks.co/stacks-101/proof-of-transfer)is the consensus mechanism of Stacks, which uses Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof of Work (PoW) chain as its anchor chain. This method further reinforces the link between Stacks and Bitcoin's UTXO model.\n\nLeather's Implementation\n\n## How Does Leather Implement the Bitcoin UTXO Model via Stacks?\n\n[Leather](https://leather.io/)is a wallet designed specifically for the Bitcoin Web3 ecosystem, which leverages the Bitcoin blockchain and its UTXO model. Here's how Leather implements the UTXO model:\n\nManaging Tokens\n\n### Managing STX, BTC Tokens, and Clarity Contracts\n\nLeather allows its users to send, receive, and store STX tokens using supported crypto wallet addresses. STX transactions follow the UTXO model, meaning they consist of inputs (previous UTXOs the user owns) and outputs (new UTXOs created for the recipient and any change returned to the sender).\n\nSince Stacks is anchored to Bitcoin, Leather interacts with Bitcoin's UTXO set to enable BTC transactions alongside STX transactions. This integration allows users to seamlessly manage both cryptocurrencies within a single wallet interface.\n\nLeather enables users to interact with Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. These smart contracts can manage and transfer crypto assets represented as UTXOs on Stacks.\n\nBy adhering to the UTXO model,[Leather](https://leather.io/blog/introducing-leather-the-bitcoin-wallet-for-the-rest-of-us)ensures that assets held within Clarity smart contracts are secure and verifiable on the Stacks blockchain.\n\nUser Interface and Security\n\n### User Interface and Security\n\nLeather displays a history of STX and Bitcoin transactions, allowing users to track their UTXOs and the associated transaction details. Leather shows the user's available balance of STX and BTC, which is calculated based on the unspent UTXOs they own.\n\nThe wallet also[securely](https://leather.io/blog/how-leather-carries-out-secure-transactions)manages users' private keys, which are essential for authorizing transactions and proving ownership of UTXOs. Leather also employs encryption to protect sensitive user data and transaction information.\n\nOptimize with Leather\n\n## Take Control of Your BTC: Optimize UTXOs with Leather\n\nThe Bitcoin UTXO model, a fundamental element of blockchain technology, has far-reaching implications beyond its role in preventing double-spending. The model's influence extends to newer blockchains like Stacks, which leverages Bitcoin's security and finality through its own implementation of the UTXO model.\n\nContinuing with our ‚Äúcoins‚Äù analogy, Bitcoin UTXOs in your wallet are essentially ‚Äúloose change‚Äù and can weigh you down if left unchecked. Leather offers an intuitive and secure way to manage your UTXOs, potentially reducing fees and streamlining your transactions.\n\nBy seamlessly integrating the UTXO model for both STX and BTC transactions, Leather simplifies the management of these assets.\n\nnan\n\n",

This provides instant clarity on your holdings, ensuring you stay informed without the need for external tools.\n\nHow to Use Runes with Leather\n\n## How to Use Runes with Leather\n\nNow, this is where the fun beLeather elevates the experience of using Runes, making it simple to manage your assets and explore the ecosystem. Here‚Äôs how you can leverage Leather with Runes:\n\n- **Seamless USD Balances**: Leather includes USD balance support for Runes, giving you real-time access to the value of your tokens. This feature helps you make informed decisions, allowing you to plan trades or transactions with confidence and clarity.\n- **Connect to Runes Platforms:**Leather allows you to easily connect to key platforms like Luminex, Ordbit, and Satflow, each offering unique functionality for Runes users.\n### Etch & mint Runes with Leather\n\n[Luminex](https://leather.io/guides/leather-luminex)is the go-to platform for etching and minting Runes. With Leather, you can easily create new Runes (etching) or mint additional units of existing Runes based on their minting terms.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1df3f65a3040780d3705cfb03d59f111.png)\n\nLeather also allows you to manage rare sat inscriptions and parent-child inscriptions with ease, streamlining what could otherwise be a complex process.\n\n### Buy and sell Runes using Leather\n\nThrough Leather, users can connect to[Ordbit](https://ordbit.io/), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates the trading of Runes and other Bitcoin-native assets. By integrating Leather, you gain access to liquidity pools, staking opportunities, and minting tools that allow for a flexible trading experience.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/b417d235d016546051b0f3c065115ed9.png)\n\nFor pro-level traders, Leather also connects with[Satflow](https://www.satflow.com/), offering features like real-time mempool aggregation, one-click bulk listings, and the ability to earn Satflow Flux points for those on the platform's waitlist, enhancing your trading capabilities.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/08d229c3aafaa023e3bedbd838459bf7.png)\n\nWhat Are Runes and How Do They Work?\n\n## What Are Runes and How Do They Work?\n\n[Bitcoin runes](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-runes)are the next evolution in Bitcoin's token landscape. Created by Casey Rodarmor, the founder of Bitcoin Ordinals, Runes offer a more efficient and simplified approach to fungible tokens. How? By reducing blockchain congestion and minimizing the reliance on off-chain data, which are common issues with previous protocols like Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThis is a big deal because a congested blockchain often leads to higher transaction fees. Similarly, relying on off-chain data can be risky, as it doesn‚Äôt benefit from the security guarantees that a blockchain provides.\n\nBy leveraging Bitcoin‚Äôs Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, Bitcoin Runes enable the minting, transferring, and management of tokens while minimizing their blockchain footprint.\n\nDo More With Leather, Unlock the Power of Runes\n\n## Do More with Leather, Unlock the Power of Runes\n\nLeather‚Äôs integration with the Runes protocol and its platforms reflects our commitment to delivering a powerful Bitcoin wallet experience.

    "Body": "## What is Bitflow Finance?\n\n[Bitflow Finance](https://www.bitflow.finance/)is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed specifically for Bitcoin users. The DEX gives users a powerful aggregator and trading platform. This ensures that users get the most value from their trades with a focus on retaining complete control of their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nLeather users who connect to Bitflow can do the following:\n\n- **Utilize Bitflow‚Äôs DEX Aggregator:**Automatically find the best swap rates by aggregating liquidity across multiple DEXs and liquidity pools, generating over 37,000 routes\n- **Swap tokens:**Trade native BTC, SIP10s, Runes and Bitcoin assets\n- **Trade stablecoins:**Take advantage of deep liquidity pools optimized for minimal slippage and fees\n- **Contribute to liquidity pools:**Add or remove liquidity without needing to supply equal amounts of two different assets\n- **Earn real yield:**Earn real yield as a liquidity provider on trading activity\nThose Bitflow features are available for users thanks to the DEXs integration of technologies like PSBTs, the[Stacks Bitcoin L2](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-stacks), and more for a truly decentralized and self-custodial DEX experience for BTC users.\n\nIncreased User Experience: Scalable, Cross-Protocol Swapping with Bitcoin in Leather\n\n## Increased User Experience: Scalable, Cross-Protocol Swapping with Bitcoin in Leather\n\nSwaps have become a key feature in Leather, allowing users to swap between BTC, STX, and Stacks contract tokens directly within the wallet extension. Our integration with Bitflow adds to our existing in-app swaps feature by giving users the following:\n\n### Optimized token swaps with best route selection\n\nToken swaps will now automatically default to the best route, giving users the most efficient swap transaction possible at any time. Leather will default to the optimal route for the swap, which saves users time and fees.\n\n### Enhanced swap confirmation screen\n\nAlong with the best route possible for their swaps, we‚Äôve also implemented a swap confirmation screen that reveals the entire token route involved in a swap. This includes any DEX hops that might be involved and the flow of their tokens during the swap.\n\nThis additional layer of transparency ensures that users can see how, exactly, their transaction is being executed while providing better insight into the mechanics of their swaps.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3fdb3a63d1f8e11a0169e336bdddb8b1.png)\n\n### Access to more tokens\n\nWith Bitflow, Leather users can access more tokens and swap options. The integration lets users swap tokens that can be found across ALEX, Arkadiko, and Velar, expanding the available token pool. This gives users more flexibility and choice, especially for those looking to explore more of the Stacks ecosystem.\n\nHow to Use Bitflow Finance with Leather\n\n## How to Use Bitflow Finance with Leather\n\nCurrently, there are two ways Leather users can access token swaps on Bitcoin: on the Bitflow platform itself and through the[Leather extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leather/ldinpeekobnhjjdofggfgjlcehhmanlj?hl=en)thanks to the integration.\n\n### Connect to Bitflow with Leather\n\nConnecting your Leather wallet to Bitflow only requires a few steps that are more generally outlined in our[‚ÄúConnect to dApps‚Äù](http://leather.io/guides/connect-dapps)guide.\n\nOnce you launch the Bitflow app, click on the ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù button to proceed. Select ‚ÄúLeather‚Äù from the list of wallets and the account you‚Äôd like to use. After you‚Äôve confirmed the connection, you‚Äôll be able to access the entire Bitflow app interface to start conducting swaps using the tokens available in Bitflow‚Äôs liquidity pools.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/eaab4571e724f5f4b36b4431ad38c433.png)\n\n### Swap tokens in-app\n\nTo swap tokens using the Bitflow SDK in Leather, start by clicking the ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù button in your extension. Select the asset you‚Äôd like to swap (along with the amount you‚Äôd like to swap) and the asset you‚Äôd like to receive in the dropdown menus.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre asked to confirm the swap details, make sure that you take note of your swap route and other details like slippage tolerance and liquidity provider fee associated with your transaction.\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/c7e81e06508a20b4abed181bc1152403.png)\n\nTo proceed with the swap, click the ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù button to begin the transaction. Like every transaction you conduct in Leather, you‚Äôll be able to view your transaction activity in the ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù tab.\n\nBetter Pricing on Swaps and More Token Options\n\n## Better Pricing on Swaps and More Token Options\n\nBy integrating Bitflow, Leather users gain access to a more secure and versatile platform for swaps that also comes with additional token options. Our improved feature, as a result, gives users a token swap experience that focuses on transparency and efficiency, cutting down on the time and fees normally associated with swaps.\n\nOf course, swaps are just one part of Leather‚Äôs bigger vision to bring the most comprehensive Bitcoin wallet experience to users. As more DeFi protocols appear on the Bitcoin blockchain, users will need a wallet that can properly connect and integrate additional DEXs in a user-friendly way that encourages ‚Äì not hinders ‚Äì their exploration of the wider Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## Introducing Leather‚Äôs New Partners\n\nIn addition to engaging in more efficient swaps in-app thanks to our[integration with Bitflow Finance](https://leather.io/blog/bitflow-integration), users can also connect their wallet to an atomic swap provider for more swap options. Ordinals collectors can now make use of a platform dedicated to Ordinals creators to try their hand at inscribing their own collections, and Bitcoin DeFi enthusiasts can now put their assets to use on a liquid staking protocol.\n\nOviato\n\n### Oviato: Made For Ordinals creators\n\n[Oviato](https://oviato.com/)is a platform made for Ordinals creators. The app‚Äôs Studio feature, in particular, makes it especially easy for creators looking to inscribe entire collections. Additionally, users can take advantage of Oviato‚Äôs Canvas tool to lay out their artwork ahead of the inscription process. Oviato effectively simplifies the inscription process by also focusing on creator tools, giving it a unique place in the Ordinals ecosystem.\n\nCTRL\n\n### CTRL: Innovating with Ordinals\n\nAt this point,[CTRL](https://x.com/SeizeCTRL)is a name that is no stranger to the Ordinals community. Their two collections ‚Äì Seize CTRL and n0 0rdinary kind ‚Äì have already demonstrated how art and Bitcoin technology can come together to reshape how we think of art on the blockchain. Namely, CTRL has sought to embody the Bitcoin ethos and point people towards a future where self-custody and decentralized financial systems are the norm. Their latest collection,[n0 0rdinary kind](https://leather.io/blog/guide-to-bitcoin-ordinals-collections-what-is-n0-ordinary-kind), in particular, has demonstrated how innovative art forms can rally an entire community around a strong vision, and how Bitcoin does have a place in the ever-evolving world of digital art.\n\npSTAKE\n\n### pSTAKE: Secure access to Bitcoin yield\n\n[pSTAKE](https://pstake.finance/)is a Bitcoin yield protocol backed by Binance Labs. More specifically, it is a BTC staking solution built on the Babylon infrastructure that gives users an accessible way to earn returns on their Bitcoin holdings. The protocol also has a governance and incentivization token, PSTAKE. Ultimately, the pSTAKE team‚Äôs main goal is to unlock Bitcoin and demonstrate how it can be a more active, effective yield-bearing asset for all DeFi users.\n\nMises Browser\n\n### Mises Browser: The next-generation web3 browser\n\n[Mises](https://www.mises.site/)Browser is the first mobile web3 browser that offers users a fast and secure mobile browser experience. Its key features include support for Chrome extensions and a web3 dApp aggregator that allows users to explore apps that they may like. DeFi users can also tap into Mises‚Äô cross-chain swap aggregator that includes the likes of 1inch and OKX, along with web3 domain name resolution.\n\nJing.Cash\n\n### Jing.Cash: Atomic swaps with BTC and STX\n\nWithout a doubt, swaps are increasingly in demand for uses.[Jing.Cash](https://www.jing.cash/)facilitates cross-chain atomic swaps between the Stacks L2 token (STX) and Bitcoin. On Jing, STX is the traded asset, and STX holder can choose to lock their tokens and set an asking price in satoshis for BTC holders to bid on. This creates a trustless, peer-to-peer market between STX and BTC holders.\n\nConclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt Leather, we carefully vet each and every one of our potential partners to make sure that our users can seamlessly continue their Bitcoin experience beyond the Leather extension itself. This past September, we introduced another set of partners that are pushing the envelope on what‚Äôs possible on Ordinals, DeFi, and more.\n\nLeather\n\n## Leather in the Ecosystem\n\nConnect to web3 applications built on Bitcoin with the[Leather browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leather/ldinpeekobnhjjdofggfgjlcehhmanlj).

    "Title": "Guide to Bitcoin Ordinals Collections: What Is Fusion?",
    "Slug": "ordinal-fusion",
    "Body": "## What‚Äôs the History of the Fusion Ordinals Collection?\n\nFusion was the brainchild of two established artists in the web3 ecosystem. Gabe is a painter who travels around to do live painting, while Billy has described himself as someone who pushes pixels around but enjoys playing with cubist art. The two shared a desire to integrate[rare sats](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-rare-sats)and artwork, stemming from their early interest in Ordinals. The project began intentionally, with Gabe approaching Billy specifically to work on a new project. According to a Twitter Spaces conversation, there was an immediate acknowledgment of the connection between their work.\n\nPhase 1 of the Fusion project involved getting mint passes into people‚Äôs hands, which would allow them to inscribe on-demand through Ordinals bot. The creators have acknowledged some complexity to the system, but they are alright with that because it disincentivizes those who are not really interested in anything but a quick turn on their Ordinals. Phase 1 launched on May 22, aka[Bitcoin Pizza Day](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-20-million-pizza-order/).\n\nIn Phase 2 of the Fusion project, which began on[July 10](https://app.mintify.xyz/collection/fusion-by-billy-x-gabe-weis/), the rare sat that you inscribe on generates the artwork that becomes your final piece. There is a total supply of 3,333 Fusion Ordinals.\n\nFusion Collection Concept\n\n## Fusion Collection Concept\n\nThe Fusion collection is art-forward and abstract.[According to NFT Now](https://nftnow.com/art/all-eyes-on-art-upcoming-collections-may-20/), each inscription ‚Äúis generated from recursive fractions of 14 of Gabe‚Äôs paintings, using the new Ordinals endpoints run through Billy‚Äôs latest algorithm.‚Äù As a result, much of the art[features](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/fusion-art)colorful blocks, lines and dots against a solid backdrop, which evokes a look somewhat reminiscent of art on a canvas.\n\nFor collection creator Billy, the artistic style of Gabe‚Äôs work was a big draw. ‚ÄúI fell in love with Gabe's work at first glance, then even more when [I] saw him painting live in LA,‚Äù[he wrote on X](https://x.com/billyrestey/status/1792572515279384807). ‚ÄúIt's been an absolute honor to work with him on FUSION‚Äîimmortalizing his physical paintings on Bitcoin forever while creating something innovative and new on-chain.‚Äù\n\nOne[popular symbol](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bnaughton_ive-spent-an-unreasonable-amount-of-time-activity-7202761737215901696-joqz/)of that innovative spirit is the preview tool, which allows people to see what the output will look like for any given sat they want to inscribe on. This gives people a direct look at what their final artwork generation will appear as and allows (to an extent) for customization based on a taste. This is key, as the creators did not know exactly what the final artwork would look like for the project as a whole, because it‚Äôs ultimately up to what sats holders chose to use.\n\nFusion Collection Development\n\n## Fusion Collection Development\n\nThe project development essentially began with Billy inscribing 14 of Gabe‚Äôs paintings and hundreds of small pieces onto Bitcoin to use as inputs that would pair with various sats. Once the background development was complete, the phased release began. This process was similar to how another of Billy‚Äôs collections, BitBlocks, was launched.\n\nFirst came the mint passes, which were available for sale on Magic Eden. Following the Magic Eden sale, holders were permitted to begin inscribing, with one pass equalling one inscription. The relatively long period of time made available to mint pass holders to complete their inscription was an important element of the building process for the creators, as it allowed collectors to take their time and aided the goal of having the best possible collection.\n\nThere were three tiers in play. Tier 1 gave carte blanche to those who owned pieces from Billy and Gabe‚Äôs respective previous collections. Tier 2 was dedicated to members of Ordinal communities who have previously done important work with rare sats in their own right or were felt to represent the space. Tier 3 was for the public, if there were to be any spots left. For collectors, there was only a network and inscription fee.\n\nThey also developed what they call the[Goated Tier](https://twitter.com/billyrestey/status/1790058464729035175), which was for their ‚Äúmost celebrated collectors.‚Äù For this tier, they planned a raffle of ‚Äúthe full recursive paintings as ordinals as well as the fractional pieces (holders of 3+ BitBlocks, Stoic holders, Ordinal Shards, Cypherglyphs, etc).‚Äù\n\nHow to Buy Fusion with Leather\n\n## How to Buy Fusion with Leather\n\nLeather wallet holders can purchase Fusion ordinals on the secondary market through[Magic Eden](https://magiceden.us/ordinals/marketplace/fusion-art)or[Gamma](https://gamma.io/ordinals/collections/fusion-art). At the time of this writing, they have a floor price of 0.00195 BTC.\n\nnan\n\n",

This option is available not just for your main balance but also across your \"Activity\" and \"Tokens\" tabs.\n\nWith a simple click on the eye icon, you can choose whether or not to display your total USD balance, individual asset balances, and even activity values.\n\nWhy does this matter? Privacy is at the core of Leather's mission. Now, whether you're in a public space or simply prefer discretion, you have the option to manage your financial visibility with ease.\n\n### Show/hide balances while managing tokens\n\nIn line with our privacy-first approach, you can now also manage the visibility of your individual token balances.\n\nThe new \"Manage tokens\" tab gives you a detailed overview of all the tokens held in your wallet. Here, you can toggle the visibility of each token‚Äôs balance, allowing you to decide which assets you want to keep visible at any given time.\n\nThis feature provides a more personalized management experience, giving you greater control over how and when you share financial information.\n\n### Simplified dApp connections\n\nConnecting to dApps just got easier. We‚Äôve streamlined our wallet-to-app connectivity interface (UI) and simplified the process to improve your overall experience.\n\nPreviously, users were faced with a \"Sign Message\" button and a string of confusing hashes. This often left people wondering what exactly they were agreeing to. Now, when you connect to any app using Leather, the UI will clearly display which account is being connected and what permissions the app is requesting, such as viewing your balance or requesting transaction approvals.\n\nTo give you more control, the connection page features two distinct buttons: \"Deny\" and \"Confirm\". This updated design ensures you know exactly what you're agreeing to, making the process more intuitive and transparent.\n\nWhat Do These New Features Bring to Our Users?\n\n## What Do These New Features Bring to Our Users?\n\nAt the core of Leather‚Äôs mission is empowering our users with more control over their assets and their data, which is why privacy is essential. Here‚Äôs what these updates mean for you:\n\n### Empowered control over assets and data:\n\n- Leather gives you more control over your assets and personal data.\n- With the new show/hide features, you can now decide when and where your financial information is visible, whether in public or simply for personal discretion.\n- Manage your visibility across multiple sections of your wallet, keeping your balances private when needed.\n### Smarter dApp connectivity:\n\n- Connecting to decentralized apps is now much more user-friendly with Leather.\n- With the latest update, the wallet-to-app connectivity is streamlined, showing clear information on the permissions being requested by the dApp, giving you the ability to either deny or confirm with confidence.\n- No more confusing prompts filled with hashes and technical text, leaving you unsure of what you were agreeing to.\nBuilding the Ultimate Bitcoin Wallet Experience\n\n## Building the Ultimate Bitcoin Wallet Experience\n\nAt Leather, our dedication to delivering a refined and user-friendly Bitcoin wallet experience remains our top priority. The introduction of enhanced privacy controls and a simplified dApp connection process is another stride towards ensuring that our users feel confident and in control when managing their digital assets.\n\nOur ongoing UI refinements demonstrate how even the smallest adjustments can make a significant difference in how you interact with your Bitcoin wallet. Ultimately, these enhancements are designed to empower you to seamlessly explore the broader Bitcoin ecosystem and unlock new possibilities for making your assets more productive.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "DMT's Impact\n\n## Digital Matter Theory and Its Impact\n\nThe Royals project is powered by Digital Matter Theory, which pushes the boundaries of art in crypto by using existing patterns inside the data. This has made The Royals an integral part of introducing DMT to the broader Ordinal ecosystem. Digital Matter Theory, or DMT, is a system of identifying and utilizing blockchain data patterns to create what are known as digital substances.\n\nIn practice, Bitcoin users have found patterns within block data that they use to generate characteristics, rather than assigning traits and designing the images themselves. This has allowed for art that‚Äôs created on-chain and by the chain. One of the main differences between DMT and traditional Ordinals is the way the data gets saved. Both utilize on-chain inscriptions. But where Ordinals save the entire file, DMT focuses on metadata related to the mint, which allows for real-time generation and more efficient use of space on the blockchain.\n\nHistory\n\n## The Royals Collection History\n\nThe collection was created by @kingpunkape, a pseudonymous BTC and ETH artist with a long history in the blockchain space. King was an early adherent to Ordinals, having also created the Bitcoin Babbies project. After seeing numerous posts about DMT and the Natcats collection, King was inspired to take a deeper dive into the theory. The result was The Royals, which launched in May 2024. The project‚Äôs goal is to set a new standard for the potential of digital collectibles on-chain. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking that whole idea of digital art ‚Äì or something that exists, you know, digitally ‚Äì and you‚Äôre just creating it in a way that it can‚Äôt exist anywhere else,‚Äù[King said in an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwS-k8DKq5g)with The Block Runner, ‚Äúand I think to me, pushing those boundaries are really exciting around crypto art.‚Äù\n\nThere‚Äôs a strong emphasis on the inherent specialness of The Royals artwork across their social media. The characters are not simply a .png or random art. The traits come from patterns on the chain because the artwork is actually made from Bitcoin. To paraphrase one of their recurring[tweets](https://twitter.com/TheRoyals_DMT/status/1840904545234534850): art that is BTC is better than art that is on BTC.\n\nConcept\n\n## The Royals Collection Concept\n\nAt the time of its minting, there were 10,080 Royals, with no two alike. However, this supply number is dynamic ‚Äì it‚Äôs based on how often the pattern ‚Äúcc‚Äù appears in the hexadecimal bits field of BTC‚Äôs block data. According to King, the goal ‚Äúwas to create art that was simple enough to be remixed, but also strong enough to have its own iconic style.‚Äù To achieve that goal, the collection is full of sharp lines and bright colors.\n\nThe artwork for The Royals comes from Core Traits that are determined by specific digits of its block number. These include the Background, Headgear (encompassing everything from beanies to crowns), Body Type, Eye, Mouth and Nose traits. There are also some special traits, which not every character has:\n\n- **Headgear**: The type of headgear worn by each Royal is determined by the last digit in the block number. These digits are also impacted by other patterns that occur within the same block number. For example, a Regal Crown would be generated if the last digit is 2 and the block number string contains \"38582\" or \"192572\".\n- **Mouth**: The appearance of the mouth is based on the fourth-to-last digit of the reversed block number. Similarly to headgear, some additional traits can be determined by other patterns within the block number. For example, you would end up with a Black & White mouth if the string contains both \"99\" and a \"2‚Äù.\n- **Nose**: The nose is determined by the second digit of the reversed block number. For example, a Cyan nose is generated when that digit is ‚Äú1‚Äù.\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/298215bc2b786dd6733713a81aaf399e.png)\n\nThe result is a wide range of unique combinations and because of the flexible nature of the eventual supply, trait rarity is a term worth using loosely. ‚ÄúNobody knows the traits for #DMT The Royals and how they are tied to the block numbers, but me,‚Äù King posted on[X](https://twitter.com/kingpunkape/status/1788389102582431842). ‚ÄúFor that reason my allocation - along with the treasury - will be assigned randomly.‚Äù\n\nAccording to The Royals Gitbook, ‚ÄúMinters battled it out on an interactive Block pad created by Mscribe in a PvP environment. Only those with WL access could mint a Royal (a first) without any front-running, creating a fair mint with wide distribution.‚Äù King has credited the Trac team for building the priv authority to allow for a fair mint. Though the tech behind the project is complex, the vibes are straightforward. The Royals community doesn‚Äôt need you to understand everything about it; they‚Äôre perfectly fine with you just liking the art.\n\nDevelopment\n\n## The Royals Collection Development\n\nFor two months prior to launching the collection, the creators hid the name of the project. This was to help preserve the necessary token ticket for the deployment. The launch occurred in May, with Phase One allocating roughly 24 hours for Bitcoin Babbies holders to choose their blocks. The following phases lasted[six hours each](https://mscribeio.medium.com/mscribes-first-blockpad-launch-partner-announced-the-royals-7e13acc354a8). Mscribe was an official launch partner and built the blockpad infrastructure.\n\nAccording to The Royals[Gitbook](https://the-royals.gitbook.io/theroyals), ‚ÄúMinters battled it out on an interactive Block pad created by Mscribe in a PvP environment.

At the time of this writing, they have a floor price of 0.0029 BTC.\n\n",

    "Body": "## What Is sBTC?\n\n[sBTC](https://www.stacks.co/sbtc)is a non-custodial Bitcoin-backed asset on the Stacks Bitcoin L2 that maintains a 1:1 peg to BTC. Unlike other tokenized BTC assets that rely on centralized bridges or trusted custodians (like WBTC), sBTC operates through a decentralized signer set.\n\nThis means that your BTC remains secure while you gain even more access to applications built on Stacks. The goal is for sBTC to facilitate additional use cases for BTC, including:\n\n- Lending and borrowing BTC\n- Scaling Ordinals\n- Trust-minimized asset swapping\n- sBTC Stacking pools\nThat‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately, sBTC will help users tap into the almost $2 trillion Bitcoin market, which has largely remained unlocked.\n\nIs sBTC Safe?\n\n## Is sBTC Safe?\n\nSecurity is one of Bitcoin‚Äôs biggest pillars, meaning that sBTC is rooted in Bitcoin‚Äôs security principles and design:\n\n- sBTC maintains a 1:1 ratio with BTC, ensuring that your BTC is always fully backed against BTC.\n- All sBTC transactions settle on Bitcoin with 100% Bitcoin finality\n- Withdrawals back to BTC (which will be enabled in February 2025) will be handled by a decentralized set of validator nodes\n- Additionally, Stacks collaborates with top-tier partners such as Asymmetric Research and Immunefi to maintain rigorous and thorough security standards\nTogether, these factors ensure that sBTC can not only be securely deployed in various yield and DeFi products but also be one of the safest assets to use when interacting with Stacks apps.\n\nThe Opportunity: Earning Rewards on Bitcoin\n\n## The Opportunity: Earning Rewards on Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin by itself doesn‚Äôt generate yield. Traditional tokenized BTC assets also often fall short due to poor user experiences and centralization ([WBTC‚Äôs reliance on a centralized bridge](https://www.hiro.so/blog/sbtc-vs-wbtc-a-comparison-of-tokenized-bitcoin)is a good example).\n\nBy minting sBTC and participating in the[rewards program](https://bitcoinismore.org/)(run by Bitcoin L2 Labs) with your Leather wallet, you can earn up to 5% APY, obtaining BTC rewards.\n\n### Deposit and Bridge BTC to Enroll\n\nLeather users who want to participate in Bitcoin L2 Labs' sBTC rewards program will need to do the following:\n\n1. Deposit BTC into their Leather wallet\n1. [Bridge BTC to sBTC in-app](leather.io/guides/bridge-sbtc)(a minimum amount of 0.01 BTC is required)\n1. [Enroll](leather.io/guides/bitcoin-is-more)in the sBTC rewards program\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/48f0029f61d50d6012205f4f3ad09f77.png)\n\nAdditionally, there is no additional service fee needed to enroll your sBTC for rewards. While a typical STX network transaction fee is still required, Leather is sponsoring these swap transactions (and swap transactions from sBTC to any other Stacks fungible token) for users who don‚Äôt have the amount of STX needed in their wallet.\n\nsBTC: A New Era For Bitcoin Users\n\n## sBTC: A New Era For Bitcoin Users\n\nThe first phase of sBTC‚Äôs mainnet launch is a turning point for Bitcoin holders who want new ways to put their BTC to use while staying true to Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized ethos. By using Leather to bridge your BTC to sBTC, you gain access to a secure, decentralized network that empowers you to earn rewards without compromising on safety.\n\nAs the Stacks ecosystem continues to grow, so do the opportunities for sBTC holders. Earn is just one example of how the asset will empower Bitcoin holders to explore new possibilities in DeFi and unlock the full potential of the BTC in their wallets.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## How a Crypto Wallet Can Be Lost\n\nA lost crypto wallet can happen due to a range of factors. Understanding these can help you decide which steps to take and how to prevent similar issues in the future.\n\n### Physical Device Damage or Loss\n\nHardware and mobile devices can be lost, stolen, or damaged. If your hardware is destroyed, you may need specialized data-recovery services‚Äîbut if it‚Äôs simply misplaced, you‚Äôll likely rely on backups (especially your recovery phrase) to regain access. Some hardware wallet companies also recommend owning multiple devices synced to the same addresses. This way, you have multiple ways to access your crypto before an emergency occurs.\n\n### Software Failures or Corruption\n\nMalware, failed OS updates, or corrupted files may lock you out of your wallet. Keep backups of your wallet data and update your antivirus or anti-malware software.\n\n### Security Breaches\n\nPhishing attacks,[crypto dust attacks](https://leather.io/learn/what-is-crypto-dust-attack), or compromised credentials can leave your crypto wallet vulnerable. When in doubt, immediately move your funds to a secure backup wallet if you suspect a security breach. Never give away your seed phrase. Always triple-check links for authenticity before connecting your wallet to a website or app. Check every transaction twice so you know exactly what your wallet is signing before confirming. Check twice, click once.\n\n### Forgotten Passwords or PINs\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to misplace login details or forget which email you used. Double-check password managers and old storage devices if you‚Äôre searching for a lost Bitcoin wallet. If you used two-factor authentication, see if you still have access to that 2FA app or phone number. A forgotten password or pin is much less of a concern than losing your secret key (seed phrase). With your secret key, you can generally always restore your wallet. Learn more about how to[secure your secret key](https://leather.io/guides/secure-secret-key), which is absolutely critical to keep your Bitcoin and other crypto secure.\n\n### Misplaced or Incomplete Recovery Phrases\n\nA recovery phrase (sometimes called a seed phrase) is your ultimate failsafe. If you‚Äôve misplaced it, partial records might still help you piece together what you need‚Äîotherwise, you‚Äôll need to turn to more advanced methods. It's important to note that such advanced methods are rarely effective or accessible for most users, so it‚Äôs critical you keep your recovery phrase backed up and secure.\n\nBiggest Lost Bitcoin Wallets\n\n## Biggest Lost Bitcoin Wallets\n\nOver the years, numerous stories have been reported of individuals losing substantial Bitcoin holdings. These examples underscore how crucial it is to back up and secure your wallet. In many cases, owners who neglected basic precautions (like storing their seed phrases safely) could not retrieve fortunes now worth millions.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre holding a few satoshis or a considerable trove, it‚Äôs essential to take Bitcoin wallet security seriously, whatever the size of your stack.\n\nWhat Happens if I Lose Access to My Crypto Wallet?\n\n## What Happens if I Lose Access to My Crypto Wallet?\n\nWhen you lose access to your crypto wallet, your funds remain on the blockchain, but you can‚Äôt move or spend them until you recover the necessary credentials. This can be stressful, but there may be ways to regain access.\n\n### Role of Seed Phrases in Crypto Wallet Security\n\nA seed phrase (or secret key) is the backbone of most wallet recovery processes. If kept secure and offline, your seed phrase can help you recover Bitcoin or any other crypto in your wallet. It‚Äôs critical that you keep physical backups of your seed phrases in secure locations and never store these online where a malicious actor might access them.\n\nLearn more about the importance of your[recovery phrase](https://leather.io/learn/recovery-phrase).\n\nCan You Recover Your Lost Crypto Wallet?\n\n## Can You Recover Your Lost Crypto Wallet?\n\nYes, it‚Äôs often possible‚Äîdepending on the cause of the loss. Here are some methods to consider.\n\n### Checking Backups & Cloud Storage\n\nRegularly backing up wallet files or using encrypted cloud services can be a lifesaver if your device is lost or damaged. You may be able to quickly restore your wallet to another device if you can locate a recent backup. Learn more about backing up securely in our Leather Wallet[Guides](https://leather.io/guides).\n\n### Consulting Recovery Specialists\n\nIf you‚Äôre confronting encrypted files or damaged hardware, recovery services or data forensics experts might be able to help. These specialists use sophisticated techniques to access data that may be otherwise unrecoverable.\n\n### Exploring Legal Options\n\nStolen wallets or unauthorized transfers may require you to seek out legal advice. A law enforcement report coupled with blockchain forensics could trace stolen funds; however, successfully recovering them depends on the legal frameworks where you live, and numerous other factors.\n\n### Community & Forum Searches\n\nSometimes, the most straightforward route is checking official wallet forums or community boards. You could find specific troubleshooting steps for your wallet provider or locate others who solved similar issues, especially if you‚Äôre searching for a lost Bitcoin wallet or encountering an obscure software glitch.\n\nHow to Recover a Crypto Wallet Without a Seed Phrase\n\n## How to Recover a Crypto Wallet Without a Seed Phrase\n\nIf you‚Äôre missing your recovery phrase, you‚Äôll need to rely on any fragmented data or account backups you can find‚Äîold device backups, cloud archives, or partially saved private keys.\n\nBe cautious of phishing attempts that masquerade as legitimate wallet recovery emails. Never give anyone your seed phrase or any part of your seed phrase.\n\nWith Leather Wallet, you may be able to[recover your secret key with backup data](http://key/).\n\nLost Crypto Wallet Prevention\n\n## Lost Crypto Wallet Prevention\n\nPrevention is the best cure. Here‚Äôs how to avoid losing access in the first place.\n\n### Security Measures for Crypto Wallets: Custodial vs. Multisignature Solutions\n\n- **Custodial Wallets:**A third party (such as an exchange) manages your private keys. This is convenient but poses a counterparty risk.\n- **Multisignature Wallets (Multi-Sig):**Requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. Even if one key is lost or compromised, your funds remain secure.\nFor more security tactics, check out our[Leather Wallet Guides](https://leather.io/guides). We recommend securely storing multiple backups of your secret keys (seed phrases) in separate locations, ideally in physical safes.\n\nLearn how to[view your Leather secret key](https://leather.io/guides/view-secret-key).\n\nThe Future of Crypto Wallet Recovery\n\n## The Future of Crypto Wallet Recovery\n\nThe landscape of crypto security is constantly evolving. Cutting-edge wallet designs (e.g., social recovery wallets or biometric authentication) may soon make it easier to retrieve lost funds. Blockchain forensics, AI-assisted key cracking, and next-generation hardware advances are all areas to watch.\n\n",

    "Body": "## How To Secure My Crypto Wallet\n\nThe first step in securing your[crypto wallet](https://leather.io/blog/how-crypto-wallets-have-evolved)is to realize that you are responsible for its security. Like physical cash, or anything else in your possession, you are responsible for the security of your[bitcoin wallet](https://leather.io/blog/top-5-ways-to-use-leather-the-bitcoin-wallet-for-web3). Wallet providers create secure and performant tools that help you, but ultimately, the safety of your funds depends on you.\n\nWhy Crypto Security Matters\n\n## Why Crypto Security Matters\n\nCrypto security matters because of the lack of recourse if something does go wrong.[Bitcoin transactions](https://leather.io/blog/best-practices-for-bitcoin-transactions)are not reversible and it is usually not feasible for third parties to recover a lost wallet. In light of the harsh consequences of mistakes, it's crucial to take crypto security seriously. Luckily, it's fairly simple to secure your crypto.\n\nHow Do I Make My Crypto Wallet Secure\n\n## How Do I Make My Crypto Wallet Secure\n\nThere are a few key steps to secure the different types of wallets offered by the many different providers. If you follow these core steps, you‚Äôve protected yourself from a vast majority of the pitfalls of securing your crypto.\n\n### Secure Your Seed Phrase\n\nEvery modern wallet has a ‚ÄúSeed Phrase‚Äù that acts as a backup. This backup can be used to recreate your wallet on another device or another wallet on the same device. A seed phrase is either a series of 12 or 24 random words. If you input those words in another wallet it should be able to recreate your original wallet. If you successfully secure this backup, you will be able to recreate your wallet even if your device is lost, damaged, or stolen.\n\nHow you do this is up to you. Ultimately, you do not want to store it anywhere insecure or where someone else has access to it that shouldn‚Äôt. Some people write down their seed phrase on paper and store it in their personal safe. Some store it in a safety deposit box. Others save the words in a secure password manager they‚Äôre familiar with. However, most should use two or three of these methods so that they have multiple sources to recover their backup. Ultimately, it is up to you to do what is best for you to keep your mind at ease.\n\n### Use Strong Passwords\n\nMany wallets have you set up a password to log in to your wallet or to enter a particular part of your wallet, like gaining access to your seed phrase. This creates a barrier between your wallet and someone who might want to gain unauthorized access to it. To maximize the security of this barrier, create a password that isn‚Äôt easy for anyone to guess with just a little personal information about you. It should be something that has a mix of characters, with a decent length of characters.\n\nDid you know each unique character added substantially increases the difficulty of guessing?\n\n### Only Use Secure Network Connections\n\nBefore sending a[payment](https://leather.io/blog/june-partnerships-roundup-making-bitcoin-payments-more-accessible), make sure you are using a secure connection. Using your own Wi-Fi or mobile network is usually very secure but using a public network like at the airport, coffee shops, and other public spaces elevates your risk. Sometimes bad actors are able to insert themselves into public networks in such a way as to trick devices trying to connect to the legitimate public network to instead connect to their malicious network. The bad actors can see everything going on through their network. This is known as a ‚Äúman in the middle attack‚Äù in the cybersecurity world.\n\n### Beware of Phishing\n\nCybercriminals have developed many different methods to trick people into giving up sensitive information. They often try to impersonate or recreate an official source to gain people‚Äôs trust and get them to give up information or click a link that downloads software that spies on the victim‚Äôs device. Be vigilant. Make sure you are interacting with the person or entity you think you‚Äôre interacting with. Don‚Äôt click on any links that look or seem suspicious. It's better to take your time and verify than to be in a rush and regret it later. If something doesn‚Äôt seem right, slow down and try to get some verification that it is indeed ok to proceed.\n\nWhat Makes Leather Wallet A Safe Wallet\n\n## What Makes Leather Wallet A Safe Wallet\n\nLeather wallet is safe because it has been thoroughly audited by security professionals, stress tested by cybersecurity professionals to eliminate vulnerabilities, and provides each user with a secure seed phrase.\n\nLeather is a non-custodial wallet that also allows users to take extra security steps, like integrating a Ledger hardware wallet with their Leather extension application, giving users an added layer of security. At the same time, they conduct their Bitcoin and Stacks transactions.\n\nIs My Crypto Wallet Secure? How to Check\n\n## Is My Crypto Wallet Secure? How to Check\n\nMake sure that your seed phrase is securely backed up. This is your lifeline if anything goes wrong with your device or it gets lost, stolen, or damaged. Use secure password managers and, or physical safes and safety deposit boxes to ensure you can safely guard it and access it at your convenience. Also, make sure you are using a unique, hard-to-guess, long password, pins, or biometrics to protect access to your wallet. If you‚Äôre taking these precautions, your funds are secure.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## What is a Bitcoin Wallet?\n\nA Bitcoin wallet, like any crypto wallet, is a digital platform that allows a user to store their cryptocurrency and digital assets securely.\n\nBitcoin wallets use cryptography to create a set of[public keys and private keys](https://leather.io/learn/public-private-keys)that belong to one specific user, allowing them to store and manage their assets.\n\nA public key allows users to send and receive Bitcoin, while a private key lets users access and manage their bitcoin. The private key should be kept safe, and should be known only to the user.\n\nHow to Set Up Your Bitcoin Wallet with Leather\n\n## How to Set Up Your Bitcoin Wallet with Leather\n\nFirst, download the[Leather extension](https://leather.io/guides/install-leather)from either the Chrome, Brave, or Edge stores ‚Äì with[mobile](https://leather.io/mobilewaitlist?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic-social&utm_campaign=pinned)functionality coming soon ‚Äì and allow the extension to run when prompted.\n\nThen, open the extension and hit ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù when asked if Leather can access deidentified service usage data.\n\nFrom there, click on ‚ÄúCreate New Wallet.‚Äù Leather will generate a unique 24-word code. This is your private key. Copy it down and store it somewhere safe ‚Äì Leather will not be able to recover this code ‚Äì then click ‚ÄúI‚Äôve backed it up.‚Äù\n\n![](https://leather-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/images/a2537f3928a888e0805cdcc5b56db0f0.png)\n\nAfter that, just set a password and you‚Äôre done!\n\nFor a full guide on how to create your Leather wallet,[click here](https://leather.io/guides/create-new-wallet).\n\nHosted Wallets\n\n## Hosted Wallets\n\nA hosted Bitcoin or crypto wallet is managed by a third-party service provider. They operate much like a bank account, wherein your dollars or other fiat currency is stored on your behalf by your bank. With a hosted crypto wallet, your digital assets are stored and managed by a provider like a centralized exchange (i.e. Coinbase, Gemini).\n\nSelf-Custody Wallets\n\n## Self-Custody Wallets\n\nA self-custody wallet, like Leather, gives users full control and responsibility over their private keys and management of their digital assets. Unlike a hosted wallet, where the third-party service provider owns your private key, a self-custody wallet gives you full ownership of your assets and the ability to manage them exactly how you wish. Self-custody wallets do not require an internet connection to operate.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\n## Hardware Wallets\n\nHardware wallets are dedicated physical devices used for storage and management of digital assets like Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and beyond. Hardware wallets store your private key on a chip that is separated from internet access. Being completely offline makes them even better protected from spyware and malware software wallets.\n\nHow to Choose a Crypto Wallet\n\n## How to Choose a Crypto Wallet\n\nThere are various factors that new users should consider when creating a crypto wallet.\n\nHosted software wallets are popular among newer users due to their convenience and reduced responsibility for one‚Äôs own private key, which is managed by a third-party service provider like a centralized exchange.\n\nSelf-custody wallets are more popular among more experienced and privacy-minded users due to their reliance on full user control and management of one‚Äôs own private key.\n\nHardware wallets are more of a niche product, but are also popular among those holding high-value assets and more hardcore, privacy-and-security-minded users. They offer less flexibility than software wallets, but very high levels of security.\n\nAs digital assets become more complex and[NFTs](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-nfts)become more popular, and Bitcoin-native utilities like[Ordinals](https://leather.io/learn/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals),[Stamps](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-stamps-src20), and[Runes](https://leather.io/learn/bitcoin-runes)emerge, more users are choosing wallets based on flexibility and their ability to handle the next generation of cryptocurrency and its related assets.\n\nWhat You Need to Open a Crypto Wallet\n\n### What You Need to Open a Crypto Wallet\n\nWhat you‚Äôll need to open a crypto wallet depends on the type of wallet you‚Äôre opening.\n\nFor hosted wallets, you will need to create an account on a trusted platform. You will likely need to provide your name, email address, and create a password. You may also need to provide photo ID and your home address for KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) law purposes.\n\nFor a self-custody wallet, you will likely not need to provide any information other than a password, because you will be managing the assets in the wallet yourself. You will need to remember ‚Äì and safely store ‚Äì your private key, which will be generated by the wallet platform.\n\nFor hardware wallets, you‚Äôll first need to buy the hardware device. Then, you‚Äôll need to download the accompanying software in order to set up the device and transfer funds to and from the device. You will also need to remember ‚Äì and safely store ‚Äì your private key in order for the device to interface with the software in the future for the purposes of sending and receiving assets.\n\nRisks Associated with Storing Cryptocurrency\n\n## Risks Associated with Storing Cryptocurrency\n\nThe primary risk associated with storing cryptocurrency and other digital assets is security. Security risks can come from third-party sources, like if hackers were to compromise a centralized exchange and potentially make your account information vulnerable to bad actors.\n\nIt could also come from poor asset management on the part of a user, like forgetting a private key for a self custody software or hardware wallet. With hardware wallets, you also run the potential risk of simply losing the device.\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Slug": "nakamoto1",
    "Body": "## The Genesis of a Lunar Dream\n\nThe story of Nakamoto1 began four years ago when Joe received a message from Forrest, a friend and the mind behind Lunar Outpost, a company developing a lunar rover destined for the moon. Forrest‚Äôs initial outreach, as Joe recalls, was casual yet visionary: ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre gonna send this thing up to the moon, it‚Äôs gonna happen in the next three to six months.‚Äù That timeline stretched to four years due to the complexities of space missions, but the seed was planted. Joe brought the concept to his team at LunarCrush, and during a brainstorming session, team member Ian Tidwell proposed a treasure hunt. ‚ÄúWe all just were like, yep, treasure hunt it is,‚Äù Joe said, reflecting on the moment the project took shape. The idea was simple yet audacious: send a private key containing Bitcoin and other digital assets to the moon aboard a SpaceX rocket, etched onto the Lunar Outpost rover, creating ‚Äúhumanity‚Äôs treasure chest on the moon.‚Äù\n\nFrom Vision to Reality: The Logistics of Sending Crypto to Space\n\n## From Vision to Reality: The Logistics of Sending Crypto to Space\n\nExecuting Nakamoto1 required meticulous planning and innovative problem-solving. The team faced the challenge of securely transferring a private key to the rover without compromising its integrity. To achieve this, they orchestrated a live-streamed event with multiple camera angles to ensure transparency. They used a rudimentary CNC engraving machine with no memory to etch the key onto metal, minimizing digital vulnerabilities. After the process, they destroyed the laptops used‚Äîtwice, in fact, after discovering a brief moment in the first stream where the key was partially visible. ‚ÄúWe had to go get a brand new laptop, reload everything, and re-stream another 50 minutes,‚Äù Joe recounted, underscoring their commitment to security.\n\nThe rover, carrying two Bitcoin, Stacks tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets, launched in February 2025 aboard a SpaceX rocket as part of Intuitive Machines‚Äô second lunar lander mission. However, the mission hit a snag: the lander tipped over in a crater, landing on its solar panels and rendering it powerless. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason for anyone to go back to it, unless there‚Äôs enough Bitcoin on there that makes it worthwhile,‚Äù Joe mused, likening it to an ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù for space projects. With the current value hovering around $225,000, the treasure chest‚Äôs worth could skyrocket as Bitcoin‚Äôs price climbs, potentially justifying a future retrieval mission.\n\nInspiring the Next Generation\n\n## Inspiring the Next Generation\n\nBeyond its technical feats, Nakamoto1‚Äôs true legacy may lie in its inspirational power. Host Sean Longstreet, an artist with NFTs on the rover, shared a personal anecdote: ‚ÄúDuring the recent lunar eclipse I was looking at the moon and realizing, I have art up there‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt even process it.‚Äù Joe echoed this sentiment, recalling his own awe: ‚ÄúSomething that I was a part of is on that thing.‚Äù He hopes the project sparks curiosity in young minds, perhaps a student who ‚Äústarts to think about what a world would look like where they can send their own rover up there to get it.‚Äù\n\nSean suggested a practical application: ‚ÄúIf there are arts programs anywhere in the world, they could so easily do a school art project to mint NFTs and send them to the moon, showcasing to the community their commitment to cutting-edge technology and innovation.‚Äù This accessibility (anyone can contribute to the treasure chest by sending assets to its address) ensures Nakamoto1 remains a dynamic, participatory endeavor. Joe envisions it evolving into a media platform, amplifying space companies‚Äô stories and leveraging Stacks‚Äô sBTC to shepherd marketing efforts in the ecosystem.\n\nThe Future of Nakamoto1\n\n## The Future of Nakamoto1\n\nAs the value of Nakamoto1‚Äôs treasure grows, so does its potential. Joe speculates that as the price of Bitcoin rises, the idea of a retrieval mission will become more realistic and could draw mainstream attention.\n\nFor now, LunarCrush‚Äôs small team of five is bootstrapping this vision, seeking community support to spin Nakamoto1 into a standalone entity. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really leaning on the community to make this something even greater,‚Äù Joe said, inviting collaboration. With its bold mix of creativity, technology, and \"out of this world\" thinking, Nakamoto1 stands as a testament to what‚Äôs possible when blockchain innovation meets human imagination.\n\nExplore more at[@Nakamoto1](https://x.com/Nakamoto1)and[@LunarCrush](https://x.com/LunarCrush)on X, and check out the full episode, Leather Lounge Ep #44, on[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5HjKIf476w0HoWVU3cg0kW?si=gdZ9Acf4QWa1DoIYuXiclA),[Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/leather-lounge/id1778092447), or[YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/PQoCDh6Npbo).\n\nnan\n\n",

    "Body": "## PoXAgents: Bitcoin Meets Conversational AI\n\nImagine managing your Bitcoin wallet through a simple chat. That‚Äôs the promise ofPoXAgents, developed by Nestor Campos from Chile. Named after Proof of Transfer (PoX)‚ÄîStacks‚Äô consensus mechanism that secures the network by linking Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain to Stacks‚Äîthis ChatGPT-style interface lets users check balances, send STX or sBTC, and manage SIP10 tokens, all via natural language. ‚ÄúMy family doesn‚Äôt understand crypto,‚Äù Campos explained. ‚ÄúThe idea is to onboard people without explaining blockchain.‚Äù Set to integrate with platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp,PoXAgentsmakes Web3 approachable, with Leather providing the secure backbone for wallet connections.\n\nKulture.fun: A Cyber Temple for Memecoin Enthusiasts\n\n## Kulture.fun: A Cyber Temple for Memecoin Enthusiasts\n\nFor those who revel in crypto‚Äôs playful side,Kulture.fun, crafted by Apollo Stargate and Blackfoot Joe, transforms memecoins into a dynamic force within a liquid staking ‚Äúcyber temple.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe wanted to give people the ability to do something with these memecoins and create more cult around their cults,‚Äù Stargate shared onLeather Lounge, emphasizing a vision born from frustration with scams on other chains. He recounted how an earlier hackathon on Solana ‚Äúgot rugged‚Äù when organizers ‚Äúblocked the Discord,‚Äù leaving participants vulnerable‚Äîa stark contrast to Stacks‚Äô secure foundation. Built on Stacks‚Äô smart contract capabilities,Kulture.funuses token-gating to create a scam-resistant ecosystem: only holders of specific memecoins can stake and access rewards, sidelining spammers and bad actors common on less curated platforms like Telegram. This blend of fun and utility ensures a vibrant, trustworthy community, with Leather providing a secure wallet to join this Bitcoin-powered haven‚Äîfree from rugs and chaos.\n\nBolt Protocol: Frictionless sBTC Transactions\n\n## Bolt Protocol: Frictionless sBTC Transactions\n\nRonoel‚ÄôsBolt Protocoltakes aim at a persistent onboarding challenge: transaction fees that stifle new users. ‚ÄúUsers need STX to send sBTC, but they don‚Äôt have it,‚Äù he observed onLeather Lounge, pinpointing a friction point that often halts Bitcoin adoption in its tracks. His solution is elegantly simple‚ÄîBolt Protocollets you pay dApp fees directly with sBTC and enables instant transfers between Bolt Wallets, all secured on the Stacks blockchain. ‚ÄúThey can use it like a bank account,‚Äù Ronoel added, envisioning a world where newcomers receive sBTC and send it onward without wrestling with secondary tokens or complex setups. Outpacing the Lightning Network in speed and seamlessly integrated with Leather‚Äôs self-custody wallet, this innovation strips away barriers, making Bitcoin-native apps more accessible than ever for novices and seasoned users alike.\n\nTruthChain: Verifying Trust in a Digital Age\n\n## TruthChain: Verifying Trust in a Digital Age\n\nIn an era where AI-generated content and deepfakes blur reality, TruthChain by Arowolokehinde and Henry Agukwe delivers a decentralized lifeline for authenticity. Built on Stacks and leveraging IPFS for cost-effective, permanent storage, this platform empowers creators to register articles, images, or videos on-chain, generating a unique hash that proves ownership and integrity. ‚ÄúYou can verify content instantly,‚Äù Henry explained on Leather Lounge, underscoring its immediacy in a world rife with misinformation. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at creating APIs‚Ä¶ to help link content into Web2 spaces,‚Äù he added, envisioning a bridge that brings blockchain-verified trust to mainstream platforms like Medium or search engines.\n\nBigMarket.ai: AI-Powered Prediction Markets on Bitcoin\n\n## BigMarket.ai: AI-Powered Prediction Markets on Bitcoin\n\nImagine betting on tomorrow‚Äôs Bitcoin price‚Äîor even the weather‚Äîusing your BTC, with AI making it effortless. That‚Äôs Antonio Meic‚ÄôsBigMarket.ai, a Bitcoin-native prediction market where users wager on real-world outcomes in a decentralized, trillion-dollar arena. ‚ÄúFrom market creation to liquidity to forecasting, AI does the heavy lifting,‚Äù Antonio explained, as AI crafts questions like ‚ÄúWill BTC hit $100K by June?‚Äù and ensures there‚Äôs enough sBTC to trade, while forecasting trends faster than traditional platforms‚Äîhourly, not monthly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre creating a global infrastructure for decentralized truth,‚Äù he said onLeather Lounge.\n\nBitForward: Forward Contracts for the Bitcoin Era\n\n## BitForward: Forward Contracts for the Bitcoin Era\n\nIshan Singh, an accounting major from New York, launched BitForward, introducing forward contracts‚Äîdeals to buy or sell at a fixed price later‚Äîinto Bitcoin‚Äôs DeFi realm. ‚ÄúYou can long the US dollar against the euro using Bitcoin,‚Äù he shared on Leather Lounge (51:01), letting you bet on currency shifts, like the dollar rising by July, in a trillion-dollar-a-day forex market untouched by crypto. Unlike typical trades you can exit anytime, these lock in for a set time‚Äîsay, 90 days‚Äîand become NFTs you can trade for added control. Trustless and decentralized, it skips banks for Bitcoin‚Äôs rules: ‚ÄúIf your long position drops 100%, you‚Äôre liquidated‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how you keep it decentralized,‚Äù Singh explained (54:23)‚Äîmeaning if your bet fails completely, the system auto-ends it, ensuring fairness without intermediaries.\n\nAdam Haun‚Äôs Insights: Why Stacks Stands Out\n\n## Adam Haun‚Äôs Insights: Why Stacks Stands Out\n\nReflecting on the Buidl Battle, Adam Haun, Head of Community Programs at the Stacks Foundation, underscored relationships as the cornerstone of Stacks‚Äô builder appeal. ‚ÄúWe engage with ecosystems and developer networks globally,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe surround them with other builders so they can form relationships to make them want to stay,‚Äù he added. Builders feel the difference: Apollo Stargate called Stacks ‚Äúfresh, friendly, and close to Bitcoin,‚Äù while Antonio Meic noted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ready for prime time‚Äîespecially post-Nakamoto and sBTC.‚Äù Leather amplifies this vibrant ecosystem, delivering the most secure wallet to connect you to these trailblazing innovations.\n\nYour Gateway to Bitcoin‚Äôs Future\n\n## Your Gateway to Bitcoin‚Äôs Future\n\nFrom AI agents to prediction markets, the Buidl Battle projects unveil Bitcoin‚Äôs vast potential‚Äîand Leather is your key to it all.
